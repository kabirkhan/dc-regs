# DC Regulations Website Data Download and Parsing

The Washington DC Regulations website at `https://www.dcregs.dc.gov` is a little outdated and hard to
navigate. The search is a bit limited and the actual regulations are sequestered in individual legacy Microsoft Word `.doc` files.

The first notebook `0.1_data_download.ipynb` downloads all individual Sections for each chapter of Title 14 (Housing).

I did an initial run of the notebook to get the docs in `./data/housing/pdf` on Feb 8th, 2024.
