TENANT ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS FOR VACATED 
UNITS
1933.1
The housing provider shall be eligible for assistance payments for a tenant through the end of the 
calendar month in which the tenant vacates the unit without required notice. The tenant shall 
notify DCHA when the tenant plans to vacate the unit. If the tenant vacates without notice, the 
housing provider shall notify DCHA within ten (10) calendar days of the vacancy.
1933.2
If the vacated unit is reoccupied that same month by another tenant assisted under the Tenant 
Assistance Program, DCHA shall credit the previously paid assistance for that unit for that 
month, on a daily pro-rata basis, to the assistance due the housing provider for the new tenant. 
However, if the new tenantâ€™s level of assistance is below that of the moved-out tenant, the 
housing provider shall not be liable for the difference.
