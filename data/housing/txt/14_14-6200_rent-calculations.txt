RENT CALCULATIONS
6200.1 
Notwithstanding provisions which may appear elsewhere in this subtitle, each 
tenant shall pay, as tenant rent, one of the following:
(a) 
Income-based rent as the greater of one twelfth (1/12) of thirty percent 
(30%) of adjusted income or one twelfth (1/12) of ten percent (10%) of the 
annual income. The value of any assets or imputed income from assets 
shall not be used in the calculation of income based rent. Actual net 
income from assets greater than the threshold described above shall be 
included in the determination of adjusted income;
(b) 
Market-based rent which shall not be lower than eighty percent (80%) of 
the  applicable  United  States  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban 
Development (HUD) Fair Market Rent (FMR) for applicable Metropolitan 
Statistical Area. If the Market-based rent is less than income-based rent, as 
determined by DCHA, the family shall pay the lower;
(1) 
Pursuant to HUDs PIH Notice 2014-12 implementing Sections 210 
and  243  of  Title  II  of  Pub.L.  113-76,  the  Consolidation 
Appropriations Act of 2014, if the application of the flat rent rule 
increases a family's existing rent by more than 35%, then the 
market-based rent amount shall be phased in as necessary to ensure 
that the family's existing rental payment does not increase by more 
than 35% biennially.
(c) 
If the family is determined by DCHA to have no adjusted income, the 
family shall pay minimum rent as provided in § 6210.
6200.2 
Any changes in tenant rent shall be stated in a special supplement to the lease, 
which shall, upon issuance, become a part of the dwelling lease. The special 
supplement to the lease shall constitute the tenants thirty (30) day written notice 
of an increase in tenant rent. The family shall be provided a copy of the special 
supplement to the lease.
6200.3 
A copy of the market-based rent schedule for a property shall be available at each 
property management office, on the DCHA web site, or can be requested from the 
DCHA.
6200.4 
At initial lease-up and with each periodic recertification or interim recertification, 
DCHA shall calculate the family's income-based rent. If the market-based rent, as 
listed in the current market-based rent schedule for the property, is less than the 
family's income-based rent, the family shall pay the lower amount.
6200.5 
If a tenant is paying a market-based rent, the tenant shall:
Housing
14 DCMR § 6200
District of Columbia Municipal Regulations
 
(a) 
Submit an interim recertification in accordance with § 6117 for any 
change in family circumstances. Change in family circumstances may 
include, but shall not be limited to, reductions in income, employment, or 
other assistance; or increases in expenses for medical costs, child care, 
transportation, or education pursuant to§ 6119; and
(b) 
Provide DCHA with a completed application for continued occupancy, in 
accordance with § 6118.
6200.6 
All changes in tenant rent, both income-based and market-based and whether after 
an interim or periodic recertification, shall be implemented in accordance with §§ 
6118, 6119, and this chapter.
6200.7 
In properties where utilities and other essential services are supplied to the tenant 
by DCHA, tenant rent payable to DCHA under the dwelling lease shall be the 
same as total tenant payment.
6200.8 
Tenant rent shall be computed after both annual income and adjusted income have 
been verified.
6200.9 
The tenant shall receive retroactive credit to credit an administrative error. 
6200.10 
Tenants occupying property for a portion of a month at the time of move-in shall 
be charged a pro-rata share of the full monthly rate determined by DCHA.
6200.11 
Allowances and special deductions:
(a) 
In properties where tenants are responsible for paying for their own utility 
bills,  the  utility  allowance  shall  be  subtracted  from  the  total  tenant 
payment to determine the tenant rent payable to DCHA. If the tenant rent 
resulting from the subtraction of the utility allowance from the total 
payment is negative, DCHA shall send a monthly check in the amount of 
the difference to the tenant;
(b) 
At Redeveloped Properties or Service Rich Properties, as defined in  14 
DCMR Section 6113, which an Association Fee is assessed, residents at 
such properties may be required to pay an amount calculated to equal the 
Association Fee attributable to the unit and shall be granted an allowance 
reflecting the Association Fee payment. The allowance shall be subtracted 
from the tenant rent to determine the tenant payment as follows:
(1) 
Any utility allowance shall be deducted from the tenant rent first. 
The allowance for the Association Fee shall be deducted from any 
remaining  positive  amount.  If  the  deduction  of  the  utility 
allowance results in a negative rent there shall be no charge for an 
Association  Fee  and  no  deduction  for  the  Association  Fee

allowance.  If  the  deduction  of  the  Association  Fee  allowance 
results in a negative amount, the required Association Fee payment 
from the tenant and its associated allowance shall be reduced so 
that the tenant rent is zero.
(2) 
If the tenant fails to pay the Association Fee on time, the fee shall 
be converted to rent, not to exceed 30% of adjusted income, when 
added to the monthly rent, for the month in which the fee was paid.
(3) 
If the Association Fee is paid after entry of judgment as part of the 
payment required to avoid eviction, the fee shall be recorded as the 
Association Fee, and the ledger shall be updated to reflect the 
tenant's payments.
