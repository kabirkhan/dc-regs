RECERTIFICATION/LEASE RENEWAL
7410.1
Thirty (30) days before the date for recertification/lease renewal for a public housing resident or a 
participant in the Housing Choice Voucher/Moderate Rehabilitation Programs, DCHA will 
provide a notice along with a package to the family to initiate the recertification/lease renewal 
process.
7410.2
If requested as a reasonable accommodation by an individual with a disability, DCHA shall 
provide the notice of recertification/lease renewal in an accessible format.
7410.3
DCHA shall also mail the notice to a third party if requested as a reasonable accommodation for 
an individual with disabilities. This accommodation will be granted upon verification that it 
meets the need presented by the disability.
7410.4
The recertification/lease renewal package will include a Notice of Rights and Opportunities 
which will include a description of the following:
(a)
The right of a resident to request a reasonable accommodation for any member of the 
family who has a disability in order to allow the individual with a disability to better 
use the residence and DCHA’s facilities and programs;
(b)
The right to file a grievance in accordance with DCHA’s Public Housing Grievance 
Procedures or Informal Hearing Procedures for the Housing Choice 
Voucher/Moderate Rehabilitation Programs, as appropriate; and
(c)
The right of residents and participants to request a grievance or informal hearing, as 
appropriate, in matters such as reasonable accommodations or any issue in which the 
resident or participant feels that DCHA has unfairly modified his/her rights, welfare, 
or status and about which the resident or participant has been unable to resolve with 
the property manager, the ADA/504 Coordinator or the department involved.
7410.5
Where personal interviews are required as part of the recertification/lease renewal process, 
individuals with disabilities who are unable to come to DCHA’s offices, will be granted an 
accommodation by conducting the recertification/lease renewal interview at the individual’s 
home or by mail, upon verification that the accommodation requested meets the need presented 
by the disability.
7410.6
If the family does not cancel a recertification/lease renewal interview scheduled at the DCHA’s 
offices or is not at home at the time of a scheduled home visit, DCHA may initiate action to 
terminate the family’s assistance. However, an exception may be granted if the family is able to 
document an emergency situation that prevented them from canceling or attending the interview 
or if requested as a reasonable accommodation for an individual with a disability.
