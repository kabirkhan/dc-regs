A vacancy adjustment, authorized by § 213 of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-

received from, or charged to a new tenant for a rental unit that may be taken by a 
housing provider when the unit becomes vacant.
4207.2
A vacancy adjustment shall be authorized only if every tenant vacates a rental 
unit:
(a)
On the tenant’s own initiative; or
(b)
Pursuant to a notice to vacate lawfully served on the tenant(s) pursuant to 
§ 501 of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-3505.01) and Chapter 43 of this 
title due to:
(1)
Nonpayment of rent;
(2)
A violation of an obligation of tenancy; or
(3)
Use of the rental unit for an illegal purpose, as determined by a 
court of competent jurisdiction.
4207.3 
Notwithstanding § 4205.7, a housing provider may claim an increase in the 
maximum, lawful rent for a rental unit pursuant to a vacancy adjustment at any 
time a vacancy occurs, unless the rent for the rental unit was increased pursuant to 
another vacancy adjustment or a conditional or final hardship rent surcharge 
within the preceding twelve (12) months.
4207.4 
A vacancy adjustment shall become authorized on the day on which a housing
provider retakes possession of the rental unit in accordance with § 4207.2. The 
housing provider shall file a Certificate of Rent Adjustment with the Rental 
Accommodations Division within thirty (30) days of retaking possession, in 
accordance  with  §  4204.10,  stating  the  maximum,  lawful  rent  that  may  be 
demanded from the next tenant.  The authorized rent adjustment shall be deemed 
effective  if  and  when  the  first  month’s  rent  is  due  from  the  next  tenant. 
Authorization  for  a  vacancy  adjustment  shall  not  be  preserved  beyond  the 
commencement of the next tenancy.
4207.5 
The amount of a vacancy adjustment shall be no greater than, at the election of the

adjustment pursuant to §  shall forfeit the vacancy adjustment, and the amount of 
the adjustment shall not be included in the rent demanded from, received, from, or 
charged to any subsequent tenant for the rental unit.

Prior to or simultaneously with a new tenant entering a lease or other rental 
agreement for any rental unit covered by the Rent Stabilization Program, the 
housing provider shall make the disclosures required by § 4111.5.
