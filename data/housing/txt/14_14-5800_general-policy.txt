GENERAL POLICY
5800.1
DCHA  takes  several  steps  to  avoid  recommending  participant  families  and 
Owners for termination from the Program.  Prior to making a Recommendation 
for Termination (RFT), DCHA will provide notice to the affected party/parties 
that includes a description of the violation, an explanation that failure to correct 
the violation may result in a recommendation for termination, and instructions on 
what must be done to correct the violation.
5800.2
Before  DCHA  makes  a  recommendation  for  termination,  there  are  several 
opportunities  for  a  Family  or  Owner  to  cure  or  explain  the  circumstances 
surrounding the violation.  These include:
(a)
Walk-in Appointment days;
(b)
Scheduled informal meetings; and
(c)
Reviewing  reasonable  accommodation  requests  that  pertain  to  the 
recommendation for termination.
