Each housing provider required to be registered under this chapter shall pay the 
registration fee established by § 401 of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-3504.01) 
through the Department of Licensing and Consumer Protection (“DLCP”) in 
accordance with § 207.1 of this title at the time its housing business license is 
issued or renewed or as otherwise directed by DLCP.
4109.2
The registration for any housing accommodation or rental unit for which the 
registration fee is unpaid shall be deemed to be defective in accordance with 
§ 4104.3.  If the registration fee is not paid when a housing provider first files a 
Registration/Claim of Exemption Form and the housing provider receives notice 
from the Rent Administrator of the defect, the housing provider may timely 
correct the defect in accordance with §§ 4104.2 and 4104.5.  Thereafter, if the 
registration fee is not paid when required, the housing provider shall be deemed to 
not have met the registration requirements of this chapter until the fee is paid.
