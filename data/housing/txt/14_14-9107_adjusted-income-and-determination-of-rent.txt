ADJUSTED INCOME AND DETERMINATION OF RENT
9107.1
The alternative rent policy does not use adjusted income to calculate rent and 
Housing  Assistance  Payment  (HAP);  therefore  there  are  no  deductions  or 
allowances applied to the gross income calculated in accordance with 14 DCMR 
Section 5306, and with the following exception.
(a)
As provided under Subsection 9103.1 at the initial triennial recertification 
only, households whose child care expenses exceed $200 a month, gross 
income  is  reduced  temporarily  (for  6  months),  by  the  amount  of 
reasonable childcare costs above the $200 per month.
