MAINTENANCE OF THE WAITING LIST(S) 
6103.1
The waiting list(s) shall be maintained to ensure that Applicants are referred to 
appropriate developments, unit types (for example for public housing, RAD, 
Mixed  Population,  General  Population  or  accessible)  and  sizes  or  housing 
programs.
6103.2 
Applicants are responsible for updating their application when there are changes 
in the family composition, income, address, telephone number, and acceptance of 
housing assistance. Failure to update the application timely may result in a delay 
in housing, being deemed eligible for housing or the Applicant being changed to 
inactive status from the waiting list(s).
6103.3
DCHA shall update its waiting list(s) periodically and to meet the needs of those 
requiring housing assistance, as needed. When this occurs, DCHA will send 
update forms to the affected Applicants.   
(a)
The request for an update to a housing application shall provide a deadline 
by which the Applicant must respond and shall state that failure to respond 
shall result in the Applicant’s being withdrawn from the waiting list(s) or 
changed to inactive status.
(b)
Applicants must complete an update form electronically, by telephone or 
mail, or by any other means established by DCHA within the time frame 
specified in the request for update package.  Once the update is received 
the appropriate changes shall be made to the Applicant’s file and the 
Applicant shall maintain their application date and time. 
 
6103.4
Applicants who do not return the completed update form within the specified time 
frame shall have their waiting list status changed to inactive:
(a)
An Applicant whose status is inactive will not be actively considered for 
DCHA housing assistance.  
(b) 
If an inactive Applicant submits a completed update form at any time after 
the expiration of the specified update time frame, then the Applicant shall 
be restored to an active status on the waiting list based on the Applicant's 
original application date and time provided that the Applicant was deemed 
inactive after October 1, 2003.
6103.5
Changes in an Applicant’s circumstances while on any of DCHA’s waiting list(s) 
may affect the family’s qualification for a particular development, bedroom size 
or entitlement to a preference.  When an Applicant reports a change that affects 
their  placement  on  the  waiting  list(s),  the  waiting  list(s)  shall  be  updated 
accordingly.

6103.6
When selecting Applicants from the Public Housing Waiting Lists, DCHA shall 
use the Applicant’s family composition and any reasonable accommodations 
requests to determine the appropriate bedroom size and unit characteristics. 
6103.7
Applicants on the wait list(s) who have requested a fully accessible unit, a unit 
with accessible features or any other reasonable accommodation through the 
reasonable  accommodation  process,  must  meet  all  requirements  of  the 
accommodation prior to being deemed eligible. All reasonable accommodations 
shall be verified and approved by the Office of the ADA/504 Coordinator prior to 
a unit offer.   
6103.8
Applicant  families  with  members  with  disabilities  who  have  verified  and 
approved reasonable accommodations for fully accessible units or units with 
accessible features shall receive priority for those units that are designated as fully 
accessible units or designed with specific accessibility features.
6103.9
The only other system for assigning priority to eligible public housing Applicants 
is date and time of application, unless otherwise specified in this chapter under, 
for example, Sections 6111, 6112 or 6113.
6103.10
Applicants  housed  in  public  housing,  RAD,  Housing  Choice  Voucher  or 
Moderate Rehabilitation programs do not qualify for the “homeless” preference 
category and shall have the preference removed. 
6103.11
Selection for Public Housing and RAD:
(a)
Applicants seeking housing assistance in the public housing or RAD 
programs shall choose either the First Available Unit Waiting list or the 
Site-Based Waiting list. 
(b)
Applicants shall not be placed on the First Available Unit waiting list and 
the Site-Based Waiting List at the same time. Applicants who select both 
shall be listed only on the Site-Based Waiting lists that the Applicant 
selected. 
 
(c)
Applicants who do not select developments on the Site-Based Waiting List 
or  the  First  Available  Waiting  Unit  Waiting  List  shall  be  placed 
automatically on the First Available Unit Waiting list. 
(d)
Applicants shall only be listed at developments that have bedroom size 
and unit characteristics for which the family is authorized to occupy based 
on family composition and any reasonable accommodation requests.

(e)
Applicants may select up to three (3) developments on the Site-Based 
Waiting list. An Applicant who has selected multiple developments on the 
Site-Based Waiting List, and has the earliest application date and time, 
shall be offered the first available unit of their site(s) selection. 
(f)
An Applicant who has selected the Site-Based Waiting List may not 
change his/her development selection after the application is received 
unless there is a change in their family circumstances that would require 
a change in bedroom size or unit characteristics. However, if the site 
selected can accommodate the required change, DCHA shall not approve 
a change in the site selection. The Applicant shall maintain his/her 
original application date and time for the newly selected site. 
(g)
An Applicant on the Site-Based Waiting List may elect to voluntarily 
remove their selection from the Site-Based Waiting List to the First 
Available Waiting List and maintain their original application date and 
time. 
(h)
Any Applicant on the First Available Waiting List may not change their 
selection from the First Available Waiting List to the Site-Based Waiting 
List.
