District of Columbia Municipal Regulations
 
3809  
PARTIES
3809.1
A case before the Commission shall be captioned as each appellant versus each 
appellee, and shall designate the intervenor, if any.  If the Commission has 
initiated the review or if a petition has been adjudicated by the Office of 
Administrative Hearings without an opposing party, the case shall be captioned as 
regarding the petition of the party that initiated the case (“In re Petition of 
[Name]”).
3809.2
In the event of the death, dissolution, reorganization, or change of ownership or 
interest of a party, the Commission may, upon its own motion when such an event 
is suggested on the record, or upon the motion of a party, substitute or add a 
person, including a trust or representative of the party’s estate, as a party to the 
appeal.
3809.3
If it appears to the Commission that the identity of the parties has been incorrectly 
determined by the Rent Administrator or the Office of Administrative Hearings, 
the Commission may substitute or add the correct parties on its own motion.
3809.4
No substitution or addition of parties shall occur unless all current and proposed 
parties are served with the motion in accordance with § 3803 and given an 
opportunity to file written arguments in support of or in opposition to a motion for 
substitution of parties.  The Commission may require a current or proposed party 
to submit evidence establishing the relationship or interest of the party to be 
substituted.
3809.5
If a party appeals an order of the Rent Administrator that was issued without an 
opposing party, the case shall be captioned as being in the matter of the appellant. 
The Rent Administrator shall be permitted to intervene as of right in such a case.
