NOTICES TO CORRECT VIOLATION OF TENANCY OR TO 
VACATE
4301.1
If a housing provider seeks to evict a tenant from a rental unit pursuant to 
§ 501(b) of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-3505.01(b)) because the tenant is 
violating an obligation of tenancy, the housing provider shall first serve the tenant 
with a written notice directing the tenant to correct the violation or vacate the 
rental unit within thirty (30) days of service (“Notice to Correct or Vacate”).
4301.2
For the purposes of this chapter, an “obligation of tenancy” means only a 
substantial obligation that is contained in a valid lease, not including the 
obligation to pay the amount of rent specified in the lease, or a substantial 
obligation that is imposed on a tenant by the Housing Regulations.
4301.3
A housing provider shall not serve a Notice to Correct or Vacate based on a 
violation of an obligation of tenancy that has occurred more than six (6) months 
earlier than the date of service.
4301.4
A Notice to Correct or Vacate shall state:
(a)
The factual basis for the housing provider’s belief that the tenant is 
violating an obligation of tenancy, in sufficient detail to allow a reasonable 
person in the circumstances to know what allegedly occurred, including 
specific reference to the provision of the lease or Housing Regulations that 
create the obligation and to § 501(b) of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-
3505.01(b));
(b)
The specific action(s) the tenant needs to take to correct the violation, in 
sufficient detail to allow a reasonable person in the circumstances to know 
how to comply with the directive(s);
(c)
That the housing provider may file an action in court to evict the tenant if 
the violation has not been corrected thirty (30) days after the service of the 
Notice to Correct or Vacate;
(d)
The registration or exemption number for the rental unit or housing 
accommodation, as provided by the Rent Administrator in accordance 
with §§ 4102.10 and 4102.11 and, if the rental unit or housing 
accommodation is exempt from the Rent Stabilization Program, the basis 
for the exemption; and
(e)
That a copy of the Notice to Correct or Vacate is being filed with the Rent 
Administrator, including the address and telephone number of the Rental 
Accommodations Division.

4301.5
Section 4301.4(b) shall not apply if the tenant has violated a lease provision that 
is required by federal law for federally subsidized rental units that prohibits any 
criminal activity that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of 
the premises by other residents, if the federal law implements a one-strike policy 
and that policy would be obstructed by an opportunity to correct the violation.  In 
that case, the statement required by § 4301.4(c) only needs to state that the 
housing provider may file an action in court to evict the tenant if the tenant has 
not vacated thirty (30) days after service of the notice. 
4301.6
A Notice to Correct or Vacate shall also state that:
(a)
The tenant may not have to vacate the unit if the violation of the obligation 
of tenancy set forth pursuant to § 4301.4(a) is related to a criminal offense 
committed or threatened against the tenant or the tenant’s minor child that 
is an intrafamily offense by D.C. Official Code § 16-1001(8), which may 
include violence by a partner, relative, roommate, or other person with a 
close relationship to the victim; and
(b)
The D.C. Office of Human Rights may be able to assist a tenant described 
in paragraph (a), and shall include contact information for that agency.
4301.7
A Notice to Correct or Vacate shall be signed by the housing provider or the 
housing provider’s agent.  If the Notice is signed by an agent, service on the agent 
of any complaints, orders, or other documents with respect to the Notice shall be 
deemed service on the housing provider.
4301.8
A Notice to Correct or Vacate shall be served on each tenant who is demanded to 
vacate a rental unit in accordance with D.C. Official Code § 42-3206.
