A housing provider may petition the Rent Administrator for a rent adjustment 
under § 210 of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-3502.10) (“capital improvement 
petition”), which shall be in the form of a temporary rent surcharge, to recover the 
cost of a capital improvement made to a housing accommodation.

the improvement is:
(a)
Made to enhance the quality of the housing accommodation (“quality 
improvement”) by:

Protecting or enhancing the health, safety, and security of the 
tenants  or  the  habitability  of  the  housing  accommodation  or

Required by any federal or local statute or regulation becoming effective 
after October 30, 1980 (“mandatory improvement”).

unit or a housing accommodation prior to the approval of a capital improvement 
petition.

A housing provider who makes, or begins construction or other work to make, a 
capital improvement without prior approval of a capital improvement petition 
may  recover  the  cost  of  the  improvement  under  this  section,  following  the 
approval of the petition, only if:
(a)
The  Office  of  Administrative  Hearings  has  not  issued  a  final  order 
approving or denying the capital improvement petition, in whole or in 
part, or such an order is stayed pending an appeal to the Commission or

after the completion of all work to make the capital improvement.
4210.6
The cost of a capital improvement shall not be recoverable through a rent 
surcharge under this section if a tenant is displaced by construction or other work 
to make the improvement and the housing provider does not comply with § 501(f) 
of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-3505.01(f)) or Chapter 43 of this title or if the 
tenant has not expressly waived those rights and relocation assistance in a written 
agreement for alternative housing and assistance.
4210.7
A housing provider shall file a capital improvement petition on a form approved 
by the Rent Administrator (“Capital Improvement Form”), which shall set forth 
the following:

improvement to protect or enhance health, safety, and security or to 
produce a net savings in energy, or a mandatory improvement;
(b)
If the improvement is a mandatory improvement, the provision of federal

That the required governmental permits have been requested or obtained, 
and copies of either the request form or issued permit shall accompany the 
Capital Improvement Form;
(d)

(c)
The tax credits allowed in lieu of rent surcharges on elderly tenants and 
tenants with a disability and any reduced rent surcharges that may be 
allowed on those tenants; and

(b)
Any interest that shall accrue on a loan taken by the housing provider to

Any service charges incurred or to be incurred by the housing provider in 
connection  with  a  loan  taken  by  the  housing  provider  to  make  the

probative of the actual, commercially reasonable costs.  The amount of costs 
incurred shall be reduced by the amount of any grant, subsidy, credit, or other 
funding not required to be repaid that is received from or guaranteed by a 
governmental program for the purposes of making the subject improvement.
4210.12
The interest on a loan taken to make a capital improvement shall mean all 
compensation paid by the housing provider to a lender for the use or detention of 
money used to make a capital improvement over the amortization period of the 
loan, in the amount of either:
(a)
The interest payable by the housing provider at a commercially reasonable 
fixed or variable rate of interest on a loan of money used to make the 
capital improvement, or on that portion of a multi-purpose loan of money 
used to make the capital improvement, as documented by the housing 
provider by means of the relevant portion of a bona fide loan commitment 
or  agreement  with  a  lender,  or  by  other  evidence  of  interest  as  the 
Administrative Law Judge may find probative; or

Publication H.15 (519) during the thirty (30) days immediately 
preceding the filing of the capital improvement petition; plus
(2)
Four percentage (4%) points or four hundred (400) basis points.
4210.13
For the purposes of § (a), if a housing provider has obtained a loan with a variable 
rate of interest, the total interest payable shall be calculated using the initial rate

any certificate filed pursuant to §  shall list all changes and recalculate the total 
interest on the loan.
4210.14
The  service  charges  in  connection  with  a  loan  taken  to  make  a  capital

the grounds for any agency’s issuance or denial of a required permit shall 
not be contested;

provided by § 210(c)(1) or (2) of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-
3502.10(c)(1) or (2)) and § (a) or (b);

Regulations existed on the date the capital improvement petition was filed 
and  have  not  been  abated  on  the  date  of  a  hearing  on  the  capital 
improvement petition; 
(j)
Whether the capital improvement petition was filed as a retaliatory action 
prohibited by § 502 of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-3505.02) and 
§ 4303 of this title; or
(k)
Any other violation of § 210 of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-3502.10)

Failure of the Rent Administrator to take action or the Office of Administrative 
Hearings to issue a final order within sixty (60) days of the filing of a capital 
improvement petition shall not authorize the implementation of any rent surcharge 
under this section, notwithstanding the authorization to begin work to make the 
improvement in accordance with § 4210.5(a).

Any  rent  surcharge  that  is  authorized  by  a  final  order  approving  a  capital 
improvement petition shall be implemented in accordance with § 4205 within 
twelve (12) months of the date on which the order becomes final, including the 
exhaustion of any rights of appeal, but no earlier than twelve (12) months 
following any prior rent increase for an affected rental unit; provided, that if the 
work to make the capital improvement renders the unit uninhabitable beyond the 
expiration of time, the rent surcharge may be implemented when the unit is 
reoccupied.  Failure to implement the rent surcharge within twelve (12) months 
will result in forfeiture of the authorization in accordance with § 4204.9(e).

4210.28
Not  less  than  ninety  (90)  days  before  the  expiration  of  a  rent  surcharge 
implemented pursuant to an approved capital improvement petition, a housing 
provider may request to extend the duration of the rent surcharge by filing an 
application with the Rent Administrator and serving each affected rental unit with 
notice that the total cost of the capital improvement has not been recovered during 
the originally approved period of the rent surcharge and requesting to extend the 
approval (“Certificate of Continuation”).
4210.29
A Certificate of Continuation shall be executed under oath and shall set forth:
(a)
The total cost of the capital improvement as approved by the capital 
improvement petition, including, if applicable, any changes in the total 
interest due to a variable-rate loan;
(b)
The  dollar  amount  actually  received,  including  any  tax  credits  taken 
pursuant to § 224(g) of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-3502.24(g)), by 
the implementation of the rent surcharge within its approved duration, 
including any amount estimated to be collected before the expiration of its 
approved duration;
(c)
An accounting of and reason(s) for the difference between the amounts 
stated in paragraphs (a) and (b); and
(d)
A calculation of the additional number of months required, under currently 
known conditions, for the housing provider to recover the total cost of the 
capital improvement by extension of the duration of the rent surcharge.
4210.30
A Certificate of Continuation that is properly filed shall be transmitted within ten 
(10) business days by the Rent Administrator to the Office of Administrative 
Hearings under the same case number of the underlying capital improvement 
petition.
4210.31
A tenant of a rental unit affected by a Certificate of Continuation may file 
exceptions and objections with the Office of Administrative Hearings within 
thirty (30) days of the service of the Certificate of Continuation, setting forth 
reasons why the requested extension is erroneous under §  or should not be 
granted pursuant to § .
4210.32
A Certificate of Continuation shall be approved only if the housing provider 
demonstrates good cause for the difference between the amounts stated in § (a) 
and (b).  Good cause shall not include  inequitable implementation of the rent 
surcharge on specific tenants or rental units or classes of tenants or rental units.
4210.33
If an order approving or denying a Certificate of Continuation is not issued prior 
to  the  expiration  of  the  surcharge,  the  housing  provider  may  continue  the 
Housing
14 DCMR § 4210
District of Columbia Municipal Regulations
 
implementation of the rent surcharge for no more than the number of months 
requested in the Certificate of Continuation.  If a Certificate of Continuation is 
subsequently denied, the order of denial shall constitute a final order to the 
housing provider to pay a rent refund to each affected tenant in the amount of the 
surcharge that has been demanded or received beyond its original, approved 
duration in which it was implemented, and, if the rent surcharge remains in effect, 
to discontinue the surcharge.
4210.34
A rent surcharge implemented pursuant to an approved capital improvement 
petition may be extended by Certificate of Continuation no more than once.
