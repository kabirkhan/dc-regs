ATTORNEY’S FEES
3825.1
Attorney’s fees may be awarded to a party for fees incurred in the administrative 
adjudication of a petition before the Rent Administrator, the Office of 
Administrative Hearings, or the Rental Housing Commission, pursuant to § 902 
of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-3509.02).
3825.2
The Office of Administrative Hearings may award attorney’s fees, in accordance 
with this section, that are incurred in a contested case before it and may include 
fees incurred for substantial work done, if any, to contest the matter while it was 
pending before the Rental Accommodations Division.  In accordance with 
§ 3802.3(b), the filing of a notice of appeal stays the Office of Administrative 
Hearings from deciding a motion for attorney’s fees until all appeals of its final 
order are exhausted and the prevailing party ultimately determined.
3825.3
The Commission may award attorney’s fees that are incurred in an appeal before 
it and shall review awards of attorney’s fees by the Office of Administrative 
Hearings pursuant to a notice of appeal from such an award filed in accordance 
with § 3802.
3825.4
A motion for an award of attorney’s fees shall be submitted to the Commission 
within thirty (30) days after the later of either the issuance of a final decision and 
order or an order dismissing an appeal, or a motion for reconsideration of the 
decision or order is granted or denied in accordance with § 3823.  The 
Commission shall not decide a motion for attorney’s fees until any further 
administrative proceedings, including a remand of the case, and all judicial review 
are exhausted and the prevailing party determined.
3825.5
If a party did not prevail before the Office of Administrative hearings but does so 
in an appeal to the Commission, and the matter is not remanded by the 
Commission, the party may file a motion for attorney’s fees incurred before the 
Office of Administrative Hearings with that office within the time provided by 1 
DCMR § 2940 from the date on which the party prevails before the Commission.
3825.6
A presumption of entitlement to an award of attorney’s fees is created by a 
prevailing tenant who is represented by an attorney. 
3825.7
A prevailing housing provider represented by an attorney may be awarded 
attorney’s fees where the Office of Administrative Hearings or the Commission, 
as applicable, finds that the claims raised by a tenant, or a specific part thereof, 
was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, or the tenant continued to 
litigate the claim after it clearly became so, whether or not the litigation was 
brought in bad faith.

3825.8
The Office of Administrative Hearings or Commission may deny an award of 
attorney’s fees to either a housing provider or a tenant, if it is determined that the 
equities indicate.
3825.9
Attorney’s fees may be awarded only for the services of an attorney, including the 
work of a law clerk, paralegal, or law student supervised by the attorney, who:
 (a)
Is authorized to appear as an attorney under the rules, as applicable to the 
motion, of the Rental Accommodations Division, the Office of 
Administrative Hearings, or the Commission in § 3812.8 as a member in 
good standing of the bar, by pro hac vice admission, or as a supervised 
law student; 
(b)
Did not withdraw his or her appearance from the case prior to the issuance 
of a dispositive order by the Office of Administrative Hearings or the 
Commission, as applicable to the motion, unless the party was 
immediately represented by substitute counsel; and
(c)
Is not a pro se party to a case who is incidentally an attorney.
3825.10
Attorney’s fees may be awarded only for services performed after a party makes 
or is served with an initial filing in a contested case, and the filing or response to 
the filing is signed by an attorney of record.  Fees may also be awarded for 
services within a reasonable period of time prior to a party’s initial filing, as 
necessary to determine whether to represent the party, to investigate the basis for 
the claims, or to prepare the initial filing.  For purposes of this section, an initial 
filing in a contested case shall be:
(a)
A tenant petition;
(b)
Exceptions and objections to, or other notice of the intent to contest, a 
housing provider’s petition or an application for approval of a voluntary 
agreement; or
(c)
A notice of appeal.
3825.11
A party moving for an award of attorney’s fees has the burden of proving the 
amount of the award with substantial evidence of the hours of services provided 
and the rates charged for those services, in accordance with § 3825.12.  
Substantial evidence may include an affidavit executed by the party’s attorney 
itemizing the attorney’s time and rates for legal services, a client engagement 
letter, or other memorialization of the attorney-client relationship that states the 
fee agreement.

3825.12
An award of attorney’s fees shall be calculated as follows, in accordance with the 
standards applied by courts in the District of Columbia under similar fee-shifting 
statutes:
(a)
A party shall be presumptively entitled to the lodestar amount, which shall 
be the product of:
(1)
The number of hours reasonably expended on the matter, which 
shall be calculated as:
(A)
The actual hours of work attributable to the matter, as 
supported by affidavits or other competent evidence; minus
(B)
Any hours of work that are excessive, redundant, or 
otherwise unnecessary; minus
(C)
Any hours of work that are attributable to, or a proportional 
reduction based on, any issue(s) upon which the party did 
not prevail; multiplied by
(2)
A reasonable hourly rate, in consideration of:
(A)
The attorney’s billing practices, including whether the 
representation is pro bono or at a rate targeted to low- to 
moderate-income clients (commonly called “low bono”);
(B)
The attorney’s skill, experience, and reputation; and
(C)
The prevailing market rates in the District of Columbia, 
which may be determined using the fees matrix published 
by the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of 
Columbia under the current methodology for the year(s) in 
which the hours were expended; and
(b)
In extraordinary circumstances, the lodestar amount may be increased or 
reduced based on specific evidence that the lodestar amount is not fair or 
reasonable because it does not reflect one or more of the following factors:
(1)
The time and labor required;
(2)
The novelty, complexity, and difficulty of the legal issues or 
questions;
(3)
The skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;

Whether the fee is fixed or contingent;

(11)

client; or
(12)
The award in similar cases.

under § 501 of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-3505.01).
