SUSPENSION OF TENANT ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS
1931.1
During the term of a Tenant Assistance Contract, DCHA may suspend assistance payments to a 
housing provider on behalf of a tenant for the following reasons:
(a)
Violation of program housing quality standards other than occupancy standards; or
(b)
Other violations of the Contract.
1931.2
If a unit fails to meet housing quality standards as determined by an annual DCHA inspection or 
because of other DCHA staff or tenant action, or the housing provider is in violation of other 
Contract provisions, DCHA shall take the following actions:
(a)
Notify the housing provider in writing of the violation and give a deadline for 
corrective action. Assistance payments shall continue until this deadline;
(b)
Suspend assistance payments, if the violation is not corrected within the established 
time period, and issue a new Certificate of Eligibility to the tenant as provided in § 
1927.2; and
(c)
Terminate the Contract, if the violation is not corrected in the following manner: 
(1)
On the renewal date of the Contract;
(2)
On the date the tenant terminates the lease; or
(3)
On the expiration date of the new Certificate of Eligibility, whichever 
occurs first.
1931.3
Payments suspended in accordance with § 1931.2(b) may resume if the housing provider takes 
required action and the tenant has not terminated the lease. Any suspended payments are 
permanently lost to the housing provider.
1931.4
The Contract shall remain in effect during the period of suspension; the housing provider may not 
terminate the tenant’s lease nor charge the tenant for the suspended assistance payments.
