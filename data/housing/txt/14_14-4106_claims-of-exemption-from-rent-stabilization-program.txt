PROGRAM
4106.1
A housing provider who claims that a rental unit is exempt from the Rent 
Stabilization Program shall file a Registration/Claim of Exemption Form with the 
Rent Administrator in accordance with § 4101.  All rental units in the District of 
Columbia shall be covered by the Rent Stabilization Program unless a valid claim 
of exemption is filed in accordance with this section. 
4106.2
Each Registration/Claim of Exemption Form shall contain a signed oath or 
affirmation by the housing provider that a claim of exemption is valid.

A Registration/Claim of Exemption Form that is accepted for filing in accordance 
with § 4102.10 shall, after review, be issued an exemption number by the Rent 
Administrator if the claimed exemption appears valid.
4106.4
The Rent Administrator may initiate a review of a claim of exemption at any time 
to require a housing provider to show his or her entitlement to the exemption 
through a show cause proceeding, in accordance with § 3926.
4106.5
A housing provider who claims an exemption shall bear the burden, in all 
circumstances, of proving its entitlement to the exemption and that its claim was 
properly and timely filed.
4106.6
Failure to file or to later provide accurate information in accordance with the Act 
and this section may result in the rejection of the filing of the Registration/Claim 
of  Exemption  Form,  a  determination  by  the  Rent  Administrator  that  the 
registration is defective, a determination in any legal proceeding that the housing 
provider has failed to meet the registration requirements of this chapter, or the 
imposition of other penalties and sanctions, including rent refunds and civil fines 
under § 901 of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-3509.01) and § 4217 of this title.
4106.7
Claims of exemption found to contain defects may be corrected by the housing 
provider in accordance with § 4104.
4106.8
Prior to the execution of a lease or other rental agreement, a prospective tenant of 
any unit claimed to be exempt under § 205(a) of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-
3502.05(a)) and this section shall receive from the housing provider a written 
notice,  on  a  form  published  by  the  Rent  Administrator  in  accordance  with 
§ 222(b)(1) of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-3502.22(b)(1)) and § 4111 of this 
chapter,  advising  the  prospective  tenant  that  rent  increases  for  the  housing 
accommodation are not regulated by the Rent Stabilization Program.  As provided 
in §§ 4111.8-4111.10, for any rental unit that could otherwise be properly claimed 
as exempt but for which a tenant did not receive notice of the exempt status prior 
to execution of the rental agreement, the housing provider shall be deemed to

after the tenant is provided with the required notice.

If any rental unit may be exempt under § 205(a)(1) of the Act (D.C. Official Code 
§ 42-3502.05(a)(1)) solely because of a tenant-specific rent subsidy, such as the 
Housing Choice Voucher program, the unit shall be registered as if covered by the

Registration Form, as published by the Rent Administrator, for the exempt unit 
stating the rent charged prior to the exempt tenancy, the identification of the 
subsidy program, and any supporting documentation as the Rent Administrator 
may require.  The housing provider shall file an Amended Registration Form 
within 30 days after the termination of participation in the subsidy program or a 
change to a different subsidy program, which shall show the computation of the 
allowable rent in accordance with § 209 of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-
