handicapped head and spouse); or
(2)
Twenty-five percent (25%) of monthly income (elderly or handicapped 
head or spouse).
(b)
The Gross Rent shall be calculated as the Contract Rent for the unit plus an 
allowance for any tenant paid utilities with the following provisions:

If the Gross Rent is greater than or equal to the applicable Payment 
Standard, the assistance payment equals the Payment Standard minus the 
Total Tenant Payment;

assistance payment equals the Gross Rent minus the Total Tenant 
Payment;
