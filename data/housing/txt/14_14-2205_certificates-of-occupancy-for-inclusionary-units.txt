Development Owner shall provide to DCRA a copy of the recorded Inclusionary 
Development Covenant along with an update of all information provided in its 
application for a Certificate of Inclusionary Zoning Compliance, if there has been 
any substantive change to such information since the filing of the application. 
DCRA shall review the updated information pursuant to the procedures set forth 
in § 2203.

After the submission of the application for a Certificate of Occupancy or request 
for  a  final  building  inspection  for  an  Inclusionary  Development  where  no 
Certificate  of  Occupancy  is  required,  DCRA  shall  inspect  the  Inclusionary 
Development  for  compliance  with  the  Certificate  of  Inclusionary  Zoning 
Compliance.

Certificate of Occupancy application or request for final building inspection for 
an Inclusionary Development where no Certificate of Occupancy is required.
2205.5
No Certificate of Occupancy for an Inclusionary Development shall be issued, or 
Wall Check accepted or final building inspection approved for an Inclusionary
