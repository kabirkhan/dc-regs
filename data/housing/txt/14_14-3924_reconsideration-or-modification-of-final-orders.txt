RECONSIDERATION OR MODIFICATION OF FINAL 
ORDERS
3924.1
Any party adversely affected by a final order of the Rent Administrator in a 
proceeding may file a motion for reconsideration or modification with the Rent 
Administrator within ten (10) business days of service of the order; provided, that 
an order issued on reconsideration is not subject to reconsideration.
3924.2
If any party files a motion for reconsideration or modification within the time 
provided in § 3924.1, the effect of the final order shall be stayed and the time for 
seeking review of the order by the Commission shall not start to run until either 
the Rent Administrator rules on the motion or the motion is denied automatically 
by the expiration of the time provided in §§ 3924.4 and 3924.5.
3924.3
A motion for reconsideration shall contain a short and plain statement of the 
specific grounds on which the moving party considers a final order to be 
erroneous or unlawful.  Grounds for reconsideration shall be as follows:
(a)
The moving party failed to respond to a motion of another party or to 
respond to an order of the Rent Administrator, which resulted in a 
dismissal or denial of the party’s position, and the party has good reason 
not doing so and would have presented an adequate claim or defense;
(b)
The decision or order contains a clear mistake in the application of law;
(c)
The decision or order contains a clerical mistake or clear mistake of the 
factual record;
(d)
New evidence has been discovered that previously was not reasonably 
available to the moving party; or
(e)
There has been a change in circumstances since the initiation of the 
petition or application that makes any relief provided by the decision 
impossible or inequitable.
3924.4
Within thirty (30) days of the filing of a motion for reconsideration, the Rent 
Administrator shall grant the motion, deny the motion, or issue an order enlarging 
the time for later disposition of the motion.
3924.5
Failure of the Rent Administrator to act in the time prescribed by § 3924.4 shall 
constitute a denial of the motion for reconsideration.
3924.6
A motion for modification shall contain a short and plain statement of a specific 
error that is typographical, numerical, or technical in nature.
