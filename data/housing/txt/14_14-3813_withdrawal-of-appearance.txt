3813.4
A motion to withdraw an appearance shall contain a statement of the following:
 (a)
Whether the party will be unrepresented or will have substitute 
representation, and whether the absence of representation will prejudice 
the rights of the party.
(b)
Whether the party consents in writing to the motion, or opposes the 
motion in writing or otherwise;
(c)
If the party has not obtained substitute representation, certification that the 
attorney or representative filing the motion has:

3813.6
If an attorney or other representative’s motion for leave to withdraw does not 
include the contact information required by § 3813.4(d), the motion may be 
granted if it contains a certification that the party has ceased communication and
