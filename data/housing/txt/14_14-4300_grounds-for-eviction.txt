accommodation  to  alter  or  renovate,  demolish,  substantially  rehabilitate,  or

information about the housing accommodation, including the address and number 
of rental units, the reason for the discontinuance of use, and any future plans for 
the property.
4300.16
The displacement of a tenant by administrative order due to unsafe premises shall 
suspend the tenant’s obligation to pay rent but shall not terminate a lawful

ceased.  If the housing accommodation is eligible for purchase under the District 
Opportunity to Purchase Amendment Act of 2008 (D.C. Law 17-286; D.C. 
Official Code § 42-3404.31 et seq.), the housing provider shall not serve a notice

or 4302.
