PARTICIPANTS  RECEIVING  NO  HOUSING  ASSISTANCE 
PAYMENT ASSISTANCE
5811.1 
Participants receiving no HAP assistance because their rental share equals the full 
rent may remain on the Program for twelve (12) months from the effective date 
they no longer receive assistance.
5811.2 
When the twelve (12) months has been reached, the Owner shall be notified of the 
termination of the HAP Contract, in accordance with the HAP Contract.
5811.3 
However, if the Owner is granted a rent increase during this period and the rent 
increase would cause DCHA to resume HAP payments, or if at periodic or interim 
recertification the participant has properly reported loss of income resulting in a 
HAP payment, the payments shall resume.
5811.4 
During the twelve (12) month period that a Family may remain in the Program 
unassisted, DCHA shall perform all of the duties and responsibilities normally 
required in the Program, including recertifications and inspections of the unit. If 
the Family remains unassisted for twelve (12) months, without reporting a change 
that would trigger an increase in the HAP, the HAP contract shall terminate after 
twelve (12) months.
5811.5 
Upon reducing a Family's HAP to zero (0), DCHA shall give the Family a written 
notice containing the following information:
(a) 
As  a  result  of  its  income  and  Family  composition,  the  Family  is 
responsible for the full contract rent;
(b) 
The Family may remain in the program for twelve (12) months paying the 
full contract rent;
(c) 
If the Family's income or Family composition changes, the Family should 
report that information to DCHA;
(d) 
If the Family remains at zero (0) assistance for twelve (12) months without 
reporting a change in income or Family composition, the Family will be 
terminated from the HCVP;
(e) 
The Family may move to another unit during the twelve (12) month period 
and if the Family would be entitled to assistance at the new unit (because 
of a higher rent, for example), DCHA will pay assistance at the new unit; 
and
(f) 
The Family's right to challenge the determination in accordance with 
Chapter 89 (Informal Hearing Procedures for Applicants and Participants 
of the Housing Choice Voucher and Moderate Rehabilitation Program) of
