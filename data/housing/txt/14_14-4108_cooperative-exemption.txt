A rental unit may be exempt from the Rent Stabilization Program under § 205(a)
(5)  of  the  Act  (D.C.  Official  Code  § 42-3502.05(a)(5))  (the  cooperative 
exemption) if:
(a)
The building, structure, or housing accommodation of which the rental 
unit is a part is owned by a cooperative housing association (“co-op 
building”); and
(b)
The housing provider claims this exemption by filing a Registration/Claim 
of Exemption Form claiming the small landlord exemption in accordance 
with § 4107; provided, that this section shall apply to each listed unit on 
the Form that is part of a co-op building.
4108.2
A  unit  in  a  co-op  building  exclusively  offered  for  lease  or  occupancy  to 
shareholders or members in a cooperative housing association (“exclusive unit”) 
does not need to be registered by the association as a rental unit under this 
chapter.
4108.3
A rental unit in a co-op building shall not be exempt under this section if it is a 
non-exclusive unit, in which case the rental unit shall be registered by the 
association in accordance with this chapter, on a Registration/Claim of Exemption 
Form listing all non-exclusive units in the co-op building as part of one (1) 
housing accommodation.
4108.4
A shareholder’s or member’s stock ownership or membership in a cooperative 
housing association shall not constitute an interest in any other rental unit in the 
co-op building as to which the owner or member does not have a proprietary lease 
or occupancy agreement; provided, that if a co-op building includes any non-
exclusive units, each shareholder or member shall be deemed to have an interest 
in each non-exclusive unit for the purposes of § 4107.
