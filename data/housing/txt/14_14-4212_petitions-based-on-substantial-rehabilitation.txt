fees, survey fees, lender’s counsel fees, borrower’s counsel fees, appraisal fees,

4212.21
After determining, in accordance with § 4208.5, that a substantial rehabilitation 
petition has been properly filed, the Rent Administrator shall transmit the petition

improvement  or  renovation  and  the  assessed  value  of  the  housing 
accommodation;
(b)
Whether any improvement or renovation is in the interest of the tenants or 
affects a specific rental unit;

an individual rental unit in a housing accommodation;

(h)
Whether  the  housing  accommodation  is  properly  registered  and  the 
housing provider has all required business licenses;
(i)
Whether, as provided by § 4216.4, substantial violations of the Housing 
Regulations existed on the date the substantial rehabilitation petition was 
filed and have not been abated on the date of a hearing on the substantial 
rehabilitation petition, except as provided by § 4212.25;
(j)
Whether the substantial rehabilitation petition was filed as a retaliatory 
action prohibited by § 502 of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-3505.02)

petition may be approved if the housing accommodation is not in substantial 
compliance with the Housing Regulations if the improvements or renovations will 
correct each identified violation.
4212.26
Failure  of  the  Rent  Administrator  to  take  any  action  or  the  Office  of 
Administrative Hearings to issue a final order on a substantial rehabilitation 
petition in a timely manner shall not authorize a housing provider to initiate any 
alterations or renovations for which a rent surcharge is sought in the petition or to 
initiate proceedings to evict a tenant in order to substantially rehabilitate any part 
of a housing accommodation.
4212.27
A notice to vacate pursuant to § 501(h) of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-

4212.28
A housing provider who has issued notices to vacate in accordance with § 
4212.27 shall obtain interim contact information for each tenant displaced by the 
rehabilitation and shall file the information with the Rent Administrator.  The 
housing provider shall file a notice with the Rent Administrator when each 
displaced tenant retakes possession of his or her original rental unit.
4212.29
Within thirty (30) days of the completion of a substantial rehabilitation and the 
return of each displaced tenant, if any, to his or her original rental unit, a housing 
provider  shall  file  an  affidavit  attesting  to  the  completion  with  the  Rent 
Administrator.  For the purposes of § 4204.9, the date of filing of an affidavit of 
completion shall be deemed the date on which the rent surcharge becomes 
authorized, and the adjustment shall be implemented, in accordance with § 4205, 
within twelve (12) months of the filing of a certification of completion.
4212.30
A rent surcharge authorized by a final order approving an application under this 
section shall be implemented as a rent adjustment for an affected rental unit in 
accordance with § 4205 within twelve (12) months of the date of the order, 
including the exhaustion of any rights of appeal, but no earlier than twelve (12) 
months following any prior rent increase for that rental unit.  Failure to implement 
the rent surcharge within twelve (12) months will result in forfeiture of the 
authorization in accordance with § 4204.9(e); provided, that if the rehabilitation 
of a unit renders it uninhabitable beyond the expiration of time, the rent surcharge 
may be implemented at the time the unit is reoccupied.
