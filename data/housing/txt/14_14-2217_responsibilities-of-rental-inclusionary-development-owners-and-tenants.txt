RESPONSIBILITIES  OF  RENTAL  INCLUSIONARY 
DEVELOPMENT OWNERS AND TENANTS
2217.1
No later than sixty (60) days before each anniversary of the first day of the lease, 
an Eligible Household leasing a Rental Inclusionary Unit shall submit to the 
Inclusionary Development Owner the following information and documents on or 
with such form as may be prescribed by DHCD:
(a)
A statement as to whether the Tenant intends to renew the lease or vacate 
the Inclusionary Unit; and 
(b)
If the Tenant states that he or she intends to renew the lease: 
(1)
The names and ages of each person residing in the unit; 
(2)
A Certification of Income, Affordability, and Housing Size that 
meets the requirements of § 2214.3; and
(3)
A  Declaration  of  Eligibility  that  meets  the  requirements  of  § 
2214.2.
2217.2
The Owner may, in the Owner’s discretion, extend the deadline established by § 
2217.1 in writing provided that the deadline shall not be extended beyond the last 
day of the Tenant’s lease.
2217.3
If  a  Tenant  is  in  violation  of  a  lease  agreement  or  rider,  the  Inclusionary 
Development Owner may provide to the Tenant a notice to vacate in accordance 
with D.C. Official Code § 42-3505.01(b), as may be amended. 
2217.4
If  a  notice  to  vacate  is  provided  pursuant  to  §  2217.3,  the  Inclusionary 
Development Owner may permit the Household to continue to occupy the unit at 
the  current  rent  for  no  more  than  six  (6)  months  after  the  Inclusionary 
Development Owner provides to the Tenant the notice to vacate. Acceptance of 
rent during this period will not constitute a waiver of the violation of the lease or 
another obligation of tenancy or void the notice to vacate. 
2217.5
The Inclusionary Development Owner shall not require payment of rent that is 
greater than the maximum allowable rent determined in accordance with §§ 
2207.2 and 2207.4.
2217.6
At annual recertification, if an Eligible Household’s Annual Income is less than or 
equal to one hundred forty percent (140%) of the higher of 
(a)
The then-current maximum Annual Income; or
(b)
The maximum Annual Income at the time of initial lease execution

for the Inclusionary Unit, the Eligible Household shall be considered 
income eligible and may remain in the Inclusionary Unit, continuing to 
pay the amount of rent associated with the MFI Level of that Inclusionary 
Unit. 
2217.7
At annual recertification, if an Eligible Household’s Annual Income is greater 
than one hundred forty percent (140%) of the higher of 
(a)
The then-current maximum Annual Income; or 
(b)
The maximum Annual Income at the time of initial lease execution for the 
Inclusionary Unit, the Household is no longer income eligible for the 
original MFI Level of the Inclusionary Unit.
2217.8
If a Household is no longer income eligible for the original MFI Level of the 
Inclusionary Unit, as described in § 2217.7, and the Inclusionary Development 
has Inclusionary Units with higher MFI Levels, and if the Household would 
qualify for such higher MFI Level Inclusionary Unit, the existing Inclusionary 
Unit may be re-designated as a higher MFI Level Inclusionary Unit, allowing the 
Household to remain in the same Inclusionary Unit. However, the original mix of 
MFI Levels must be restored within the Inclusionary Development as soon as 
possible, so the property manager should re-designate a new unit with the same 
number of Bedrooms to replace the lower MFI Level Inclusionary Unit that was 
re-designated when one becomes available. The property manager or Inclusionary 
Development  Owner  must  notify  DHCD  in  writing  that  a  re-designation  is 
necessary as soon as it is determined and identify the unit to be re-designated.
2217.9
If a Household is no longer income eligible for the original MFI Level of the 
Inclusionary Unit, as described in § 2217.7, and the Inclusionary Development 
does  not  have  Inclusionary  Units  with  higher  MFI  Levels  for  which  the 
Household qualifies, the Household may remain in the Inclusionary Unit if the 
Household agrees to pay market rate rent.  In such case, the Inclusionary Unit 
may be re-designated as a Market Rate Unit, allowing the Household to remain in 
the same unit. However, the original mix of MFI Levels must be restored within 
the Inclusionary Development as soon as possible, so the property manager 
should re-designate a new unit with the same number of Bedrooms to replace the 
Inclusionary  Unit  that  was  re-designated  when  one  becomes  available.  The 
property manager or Inclusionary Development Owner must notify DHCD in 
writing that a re-designation is necessary as soon as it is determined and identify 
the unit to be re-designated.
2217.10
Annually within fifteen (15) days after the anniversary of the first lease agreement 
for an Inclusionary Unit in a Rental Inclusionary Development, the Inclusionary 
Development Owner shall submit a report to DHCD setting forth the following 
information for the entire Rental Inclusionary Development:
