LATE FEES
4306.1
No late fee shall be charged to a tenant of a rental unit covered by the Act unless a 
valid, written lease for the tenant’s rental unit explicitly states:
(a)
The grace period after the regular due date of the rent by which the rent 
due must be paid to avoid a late fee, in accordance with § 4306.2; and
(b)
The maximum amount the late fee that may be charged, in accordance 
with § 4306.3.
4306.2
No late fee shall be charged to a tenant if full payment of the rent is made within 
five (5) days of the date on which it is due, or any longer grace period as may be 
provided in the lease for the rental unit.
4306.3
No lease shall provide for a late fee in excess of five percent (5%) of the rent that 
is due on a particular date.
4306.4
No late fee shall be charged to a tenant for the late payment or nonpayment of any 
portion of the rent charged for a rental unit that a rent subsidy provider, rather 
than the tenant, is responsible for paying.
4306.5
If a late fee is charged to a tenant, the housing provider shall not:
(a)
Charge the tenant interest on the late fee;
(b)
Deduct any amount from a subsequent rent payment as payment of the late 
fee;
(c)
Charge more than one late fee for a particular overdue rent payment; 
(d)
Evict the tenant on the basis of the nonpayment of the late fee; or
(e)
Impose a late fee on a tenant for nonpayment of rent or any portion of rent 
that a rent subsidy provider, rather than the tenant, is responsible for 
paying.
4306.6
If a housing provider serves a tenant notice to vacate a rental unit or otherwise 
initiates proceedings to evict the tenant based, in whole or in part, on the 
nonpayment of a late fee, the late fee shall be deemed invalid, effective on the 
date it was charged; provided, that nothing in this subsection shall prevent a 
housing provider from joining an action for possession based on unpaid rent with 
an action on a debt based on unpaid late fees.
4306.7
A housing provider may deduct an allowable, unpaid late fee from the tenant’s 
security deposit at the end of a tenancy, in accordance with § 309 of this title, if

the housing provider, after the grace period provided by § 4306.2, issues an 
invoice to the tenant providing thirty (30) days for the payment of the late fee and 
the late fee is not received within that time.
4306.8
If a housing provider knowingly or willfully demands or receives a late fee in 
excess of the amount stated in the tenant’s lease or the amount allowed by this 
section, or knowingly or willfully charges a late fee that is not allowed by this 
section, the housing provider shall be liable to the tenant for the amount by which 
the late fee demanded or received exceeds the allowable late fee.
4306.9
A housing provider’s liability under § 4306.8 shall be trebled if detailed findings 
of fact are made that the housing provider acted in bad faith.
