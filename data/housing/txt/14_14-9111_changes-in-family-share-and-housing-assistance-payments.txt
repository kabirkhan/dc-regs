CHANGES IN FAMILY SHARE AND HOUSING ASSISTANCE 
PAYMENT
9111.1 
Households are not required to report changes in income during the three-year 
period between recertifications; however, they must report changes in household 
composition.  This includes both additions and removals of members (including 
the death of any member) to the household, so that DCHA may determine 
continued eligibility for housing assistance.
9111.2
Unless the addition or change in members results in a required change in the 
voucher bedroom size, no income information shall be requested.
9111.3 
If the removal of a household member results in a decrease in income, the 
household may request an interim certification to reset the TTP.  If the loss of 
income causes the household’s retrospective income to drop by more than 10 
percent of its previously established retrospective income level, the TTP shall be 
reset.  
9111.4
If the addition or removal of a household member results in a change in the 
appropriate voucher bedroom size, DCHA shall review the income of the new or 
removed member only, apply the appropriate utility allowance for the bedroom 
size and shall reset the TTP.  If there is a reduction in subsidy or increase in 
family share, DCHA shall automatically grant a one-time hardship for six months 
to allow the Family to move to an affordable unit. 
9111.5
If the removal of a household member from the family composition results in a 
reduction in income that cannot be feasibly replaced, that Household member’s 
income shall not be included in the retrospective income calculation at the interim 
recertification.
