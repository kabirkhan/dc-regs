HARDSHIP WAIVER POLICY
9118.1 
A  Family  may  request  a  Hardship  waiver  at  any  time  if  the  family  can 
demonstrate  one  of  the  following  circumstances  listed  below.  If  the  family 
receives a temporary TTP during the initial grace period, then the family may 
request a hardship waiver no more than thirty (30) days before the expiration of 
the initial grace period or thereafter.
(a)
After the effective date of the TTP, the new TTP has put the Family at 
imminent risk of eviction as a result of non-payment of rent, and the 
hardship cannot be remedied by the one interim recertification permitted 
each year (which cannot reduce a household’s TTP below the minimum 
level);
(b)
The Family is at an income level or experiences a loss of income and/or a 
TTP increase such that its total monthly TTP exceeds forty percent (40%) 
of its current monthly gross income. Any amount by which the gross rent 
exceeds the payment standard must be paid by the family and is not used 
in determining this forty percent (40%) rent burden. The gross income 
shall include imputed income in the same manner as current calculations;
(c)
Zero household income;
(d)
Loss of eligibility for a federal state, or local assistance program which 
reduces the Family income such that the total monthly TTP exceeds forty 
percent (40%) of its current monthly gross income; 
(e)
Temporary or permanent disability, incapacitation or illness, or death of a 
household member, which reduces the Family income such that the total 
monthly TTP exceeds forty percent (40%) of its current monthly gross 
income; 
(f)
Significant income loss because of other changed circumstances, including 
the loss of employment, reduction in work hours or pay, or loss of public 
benefits; or 
(g)
Other circumstances as determined by DCHA.
9118.2 
The process for requesting a Hardship Waiver is as follows:

(c)

work hours, or loss of federal, state or local assistance; or the temporary or 
permanent disability, incapacitation or illness, or death of a household 
member and amount of lost income.
(e)
If the Head of Household claims zero household income as part of its 
hardship request, it must provide a detailed accounting of funds used to 
cover basic costs of living (food, personal/family care necessities, etc.). 
(f)
To receive a hardship based on the risk of eviction for non-payment of 
rent, a household must provide a copy of a rent ledger showing an 
accruing balance, a notice from the landlord, a thirty (30) day Notice to 
Vacate or Cure or a Summons and Complaint from the landlord for non-
payment of rent or any other proof acceptable to DCHA.
(g)
To receive hardship based on the risk of utility shut-off, a household must 
provide a copy of a shut-off notice, a recent bill from the utility company 
showing an accruing balance, a notice from the landlord, or any other 
proof acceptable to DCHA. 
9118.3
The Hardship Review Process is as follows:

The Head of Household may review and obtain a copy of the Family’s 
HCVP file and/or copies of documents or evidence that DCHA relies upon 
in making any Hardship determination.

DCHA shall review the Hardship Request and any evidence submitted by 
the Head of Household in accordance with this section and provide written 
notice to the Head of Household within ten (10) business days of its 
decision to grant or deny the Hardship requests. 
(c)
DCHA shall review all information submitted by the Head of Household 
regarding the request for Hardship and document its decision in the Head 
of Household file.
(d)
Where a Hardship Waiver is denied, the Head of Household may request 
an informal review of DCHA’s denial to the Director of the Housing
