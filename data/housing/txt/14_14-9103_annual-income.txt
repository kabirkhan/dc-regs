ANNUAL INCOME
9103.1
For the purposes of determining all forms of income for families participating in 
the program, DCHA shall follow HUD requirements to verify income, but shall 
calculate and treat gross annual income as follows:
(a)
To establish annual gross income for the three year certification period, 
DCHA shall review the total household income without deductions for the 
twelve-month  period  prior  to  recertification,  i.e.,  the  “retrospective 
income.”  The household’s TTP shall depend on its retrospective income 
during a 12 month “look back” period.  
(b)
If,  at  the  initial  enrollment/  recertification,  the  household’s  current/ 
anticipated income is less than its retrospective income by more than 10%, 
a “temporary” TTP based on current income alone shall be set for a six 
month grace period.    
(c)
If, at the initial triennial certification only (this is a one-time reduction for 
a household), the childcare expense exceeds $200 per month, the gross 
income shall be reduced by a deduction of reasonable childcare costs 
above the $200 per month, to create a “temporary” TTP for a six month 
grace period.  After the grace period, the TTP shall revert to the amount 
based upon the previously determined average retrospective income.
(d)
Income recalculations shall be initiated by DCHA only triennially. 
(e)
If the household reports a decrease in income or a change in household 
composition that requires a recalculation of the family’s share of rent, the 
annual income can be recalculated once per year pursuant to Section 9113.
