District of Columbia Municipal Regulations

APPLYING UTILITY ALLOWANCES
9105.1
A DCHA-established utility allowance schedule is used in determining Family 
Share and HAP.  DCHA shall use the appropriate utility for the lesser of the 
dwelling unit actually leased by a family or the voucher unit size for which the 
Family qualifies using DCHA subsidy standards.
9105.2 
When utility schedules are updated to reflect rate changes, utility allowances (and 
UAPs) shall be adjusted only when HAP subsidies or TTPs are recalculated for 
other reasons. More specifically, updated utility schedules shall be applied when 
households: (1) face a contract rent change, (2) have their TTPs recalculated 
during interim or triennial recertifications, (3) move to new units, or (4) have a 
change in household composition requiring a change in voucher size.
