ACHIEVING  YOUR  BEST  LIFE  PROGRAM  IN  RAD 
COVERED PROJECTS
5775.1
Achieving Your Best Life (“AYBL”), governed by rules found at 14 DCMR §§ 
9800 et seq., is a program that allows public housing residents in the District to 
increase earned income and to prepare to purchase a home or rent in the private 
market without government assistance.
5775.2
When a public housing project coverts under RAD, those tenants who have 
already entered into an AYBL contract as required under 14 DCMR § 9817 will 
remain  in  the  AYBL  program  until  the  AYBL  contract  terminates.  The 
regulations enumerated at 14 DCMR §§ 9800 et seq. will continue to govern these 
residents’ participation in the ABYL program, even though DCHA will no longer 
be functioning as landlord for the property.
5775.3
Until the AYBL contract terminates, monthly tenant rent shall be reduced by the 
amount paid that month by a household member into an AYBL account.
5775.4
Residents of units funded by project-based voucher assistance are not eligible for 
admission to the ABYL program.
