4216.3
In reviewing a housing provider’s petition or application for a rent adjustment for 
which  prior  administrative  approval  is  required,  there  shall  be  a  rebuttable 
presumption of substantial compliance with the Housing Regulations for each

(a)
All rental units in the housing accommodation have been inspected at the 
housing  provider’s  request  by  the  Department  of  Buildings  (“DOB”) 
within thirty (30) days immediately preceding the date of filing of the

or such other time period as DOB may have required in the 
citation;
(2)
Has been certified by DOB, or by the housing provider or by each 
tenant affected by the violation and supporting evidence has been 
presented to substantiate the certification; and
(3)
Each tenant proposed to be affected by the rent adjustment has 
been given notice of the certification and ten (10) days, from the 
date the housing provider submits certification of abatement to the 
Office of Administrative Hearings, in which to submit objections

District of Columbia Municipal Regulations
 
filed while an affected rental unit or housing accommodation is not in substantial 
compliance with the Housing Regulations, in violation of § 4216.1, the rent 
adjustment shall not be approved unless the non-compliance has been abated at 
the time of an evidentiary hearing on the petition.
4216.5
Evidence of substantial violations of the Housing Regulations may be presented at 
a hearing by notices of violations issued by any District or federal agency with 
jurisdiction over the particular violation or by the testimony of witnesses.
4216.6
Witness  testimony  may  be  supported  by  photographs  or  other  documentary 
evidence, written government-issued violation notice(s), or the testimony of a 
government official who has personally inspected the rental property.
4216.7
Testimony  and  other  supporting  evidence  of  violations  of  the  Housing 
Regulations shall be as detailed as necessary so that the Administrative Law 
Judge can make findings of fact that identify:
(a)
The specific violation and that it is substantial;
(b)
The location and duration of the condition alleged to be a violation, and 
whether it has been abated; and
(c)
Whether and when the housing provider had actual or constructive notice 
of the specific condition alleged to be a violation.

§ 208(a)(2) of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-3502.08(a)(2)) shall be based 
upon findings as provided in § 4216.7; provided, that a rent rollback authorized 
by § 208(a)(2) shall not be ordered if the violations have been abated.
4216.9
Unsuccessful efforts by a housing provider to abate a substantial violation of the 
Housing Regulations shall not constitute a defense to a claim based on the 
existence of the violation.
4216.10
In  addition  to  § 4216.1,  a  housing  provider’s  failure  to  promptly  abate  a 
substantial violation of the Housing Regulations, where the violation is not the 
result of tenant neglect or misconduct, shall also constitute a reduction in related 
services under § 211 of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-3502.11) and § 4211 of 
this chapter.
