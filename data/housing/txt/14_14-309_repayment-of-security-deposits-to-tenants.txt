do one of the following:

Tender payment to the tenant, without demand, any security deposit and 
any similar payment paid by the tenant as a condition of tenancy in

deposit or payment as provided in paragraph (4)(a) and (a-1) (14 DCMR § 
311); or
(2)
Notify the tenant in writing, to be delivered to the tenant personally or by

withhold and apply the monies toward defraying the cost of expenses 
properly incurred under the terms and conditions of the security deposit 
agreement.
309.2
The  owner,  within  30  days  after  notification  to  the  tenant  pursuant  to  the 
requirement of paragraph (2)(a)(2) (14 DCMR § 309.1(b)), shall tender a refund 
of the balance of the deposit or payment, including interest not used to defray 
such expenses, and at the same time give the tenant an itemized statement of the 
repairs and other uses to which the monies were applied and the cost of each 
repair or other use.
309.3
Failure by the owner to comply with § 309.1 and § 309.2 of this section shall 
constitute prima facie evidence that the tenant is entitled to full return, including 
interest as provided in § 311, of any deposit or other payment made by the tenant 
as security for performance of his or her obligations or as a condition of tenancy, 
in addition to the stipulated rent.
309.4
Failure by the owner to serve the tenant personally or by certified mail, after good 
faith effort to do so, shall not constitute a failure by the owner to comply with § 
309.1 and § 309.2.
309.5 
(1) 
Any housing provider violating the provisions of this section by failing 
to return a security deposit rightfully owed to a tenant in accordance with 
the requirements of this section shall be liable for the amount of the 
deposit withheld or, in the event of bad faith, for treble damages. 
 (2) 
For the purposes of this sub-paragraph, the term “bad faith” means any 
frivolous or unfounded refusal to return a security deposit, as required by 
law, that is motivated by a fraudulent, deceptive, misleading, dishonest, 
or unreasonably self-serving purpose and not by simple negligence, bad 
judgment, or an honest belief in the course of action taken.
