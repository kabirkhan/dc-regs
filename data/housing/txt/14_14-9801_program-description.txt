PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
9801.1 
The District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA) recognizes the need to 
encourage families in their efforts to attain self-sufficiency.  As such, DCHA 
establishes the Achieving Your Best Life Rewards Program (AYBL), a self-
sufficiency  program  structured  around  DCHA  designated  Public  Housing 
developments known as Rewards Properties.  Participating AYBL Families reside 
at these developments while preparing to become (1) homeowners; or (2) sign a 
lease in the private market without federal or local housing assistance.  Although 
the primary goal of the program is to prepare public housing families to become 
homeowners or renters in the private market by reducing their dependency on 
public and housing subsidies, families also set self-declared goals related to 
achieving homeownership or renting in the private market without federal or local 
housing  assistance.   In  an  effort  to  assist  families  to  become  homeowners, 
DCHA’s goal is to connect residents with available resources and services in such 
areas as credit and budget counseling, general life skills, job readiness assessment 
and training, home ownership counseling, education/vocational training and self- 
improvement workshops.  Through case management and active participation, 
families will be connected with community services and related programs critical 
to their success.  Participation in the AYBL program is voluntary.
