UTILITY PAYMENTS AND REIMBURSEMENTS
9104.1
DCHA, under its MTW Authority, established its “Simplified Utility Allowance 
Schedule.” The calculation of the Utility Allowance and Reimbursements shall be 
in accordance with Sections 5311 and 5322 of Title 14, pursuant to DCHA 
Moving To Work authority.  
9104.2
If, when the utility allowance is subtracted from the household’s TTP, the family 
rent to owner is lower than the minimum rent of $75; the utility allowance shall 
be  partially  reimbursed  to  the  family  through  a  deposit  on  the  utility 
reimbursement debit card provided by DCHA. The amount of the deposit on the 
utility reimbursement debit card shall be the total utility allowance minus the 
difference  between  the  TTP  and  the  minimum  rent  of  $75.   Under  these 
circumstances the family shall be responsible to pay the owner $75 rent each 
month.
