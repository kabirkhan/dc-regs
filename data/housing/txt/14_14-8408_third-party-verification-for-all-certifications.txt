THIRD PARTY VERIFICATION FOR ALL 
CERTIFICATIONS
8408.1
In order to determine the adjusted Annual Income of any Participant family either upon initial 
certification or upon any examination as set forth in this Chapter, and except as otherwise 
provided in the Administrative Plan, adopted pursuant to 24 CFR § 982.54, the DCHA is required 
to obtain and retain in the file of each Family, documentation which provides third party 
verification of the following:
(a)
Annual Income of the Participant family;
(b)
The value of the household’s assets;
(c)
Allowances or deductions from Annual Income; and
(d)
Other factors affecting adjusted Annual Income as required in this Title or the 
requirements, guidelines or notices published by HUD from time to time.
8408.2
If third party verification is not complete or available for income or assets, DCHA must 
document the efforts made to obtain such verification. Income can be included without 
verification. Deductions, allowances or other factors affecting adjusted gross income are not 
allowed without third party verification.
8408.3
Verifications may be required, at the discretion of DCHA, more frequently than annually for 
certain types of certifications, such as a self-certification of zero ($0) Annual Income for the 
household.
8408.4
DCHA allows ten (10) business Days for the return of third party verifications or any Participant 
family documents or certifications.
8408.5
Verifications may not be more than one hundred twenty (120) Days old at the time a voucher is 
issued.
8408.6
Income information provided by the Family will be verified using the HUD approved Upfront 
Income Verification method (UIV). This includes verification from HUD’s computerized 
Enterprise Income Verification System, similar District of Columbia government computer based 
systems and non-government web based systems. Family provided income information will be 
verified as follows:
(a)
In the event the Family provided income information is verified by the UIV method 
no further verification is required;
(b)
In the event the Family provided income information is substantially different 
(variance of more then two hundred dollars ($200.00) per month), the family disputes 
the UIV data or additional information is required, the following hierarchy of 
verification methods will be followed:
(i)
Written third party verification;
(ii)
Oral third party verification;
(iii)
Family provided documentation; or
(iv)
Family declaration under oath; and
(c)
Verification of required family information concerning assets, Full Time Student 
status, medical expenses, requests for larger units, preference status, and zero ($0) 
income status shall be obtained by written third party verification. If the written third 
party verification is unobtainable after diligent efforts by DCHA then the hierarchy in 
(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of this Subsection shall be followed.
