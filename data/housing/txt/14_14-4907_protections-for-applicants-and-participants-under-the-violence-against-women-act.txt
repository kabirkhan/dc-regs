PROTECTIONS  FOR  APPLICANTS  AND  PARTICIPANTS 
UNDER THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT
4907.1
In certain circumstances, as further explained below, applicants or participants 
may be afforded additional protections from HCVP requirements and policies 
under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).  DCHA shall comply with the 
terms of VAWA in administration of the HCVP. VAWA protections are for 
victims  of  domestic  violence,  dating  violence,  sexual  assault,  and  stalking, 
regardless  of  sex,  gender  identity,  or  sexual  orientation.  DCHA  shall  not 
discriminate against VAWA victims on the basis of any protected categories 
pursuant to 24 CFR § 5.105(a) including race, color, national origin, religion, sex, 
familial status, disability, or age.
4907.2
Applicants seeking admission to the Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP) 
or to a Project-Based Voucher unit shall not be denied admission on the basis of, 
or as a direct result of, the fact that the applicant is or has been a victim of 
domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, if the applicant 
otherwise qualifies for admission, assistance, participation, or occupancy. 
4907.3
Family or a Family member participant shall not be terminated from the Housing 
Choice Voucher Program (HCVP) or a Project-Based Voucher unit on the basis 
of, or as a direct result of, the fact that the family member participant is or has 
been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
4907.4
If a member of the assisted Family is removed from the family composition due to 
that member of the assisted Family being the perpetrator in criminal acts of 
domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking and the victim is 
part of the assisted Family, the perpetrator may not be considered a remaining 
Family member or an eligible Family member.
4907.5
In making its decision as to who retains assistance, DCHA shall consider all 
credible evidence, including, but not limited to, documentation submitted to 
DCHA pursuant to § 4907.12. 
4907.6
(a)  
Pursuant to federal regulations, the denial of continued HCVP assistance 
to a Family member who engages in criminal acts related to domestic 
violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking against members of 
the assisted Family shall be considered a form of termination of the 
individual Family member. DCHA shall follow the procedures described 
in Chapters 58 and 89 of this title of the DCMR when terminating 
assistance to such an individual, unless the individual is absent or expected 
to be absent pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection.
(b) 
If the Family member who engages in criminal acts related to domestic 
violence,  dating  violence,  sexual  assault,  or  stalking  against  another 
Housing
14 DCMR § 4907
District of Columbia Municipal Regulations
 
Family member is absent, or expected to be absent due to court order or 
incarceration, from the assisted unit for more than one hundred and twenty 
(120) consecutive days, DCHA shall remove that Family member and the 
individual shall no longer be considered part of the family composition.
(c) 
An absent family member removed from the family composition pursuant 
to paragraph (b) of this subsection shall also be denied continued HCVP 
assistance.  DCHA  shall  follow  the  same  procedures  as  described  in 
Chapters 58 and 89 of this title of the DCMR when terminating of the 
participation of the removed absent family member.
4907.7
Pursuant to federal regulations, criminal activity directly related to domestic 
violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, engaged in by a member of a 
participant's  household  or  any  guest  or  other  person  under  the  participant's 
control, shall not be cause for termination of tenancy, occupancy rights of, or 
assistance to the victim, if the participant or immediate family member of the 
participant is the victim. 
4907.8
Notwithstanding § 4907.7, DCHA may terminate assistance to a participant for 
violating a program obligation not premised on an act of domestic violence, 
dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, provided that DCHA does not subject 
such a participant to a more demanding standard than other participants in making 
the determination to terminate assistance to the participant. 
4907.9
A victim of domestic violence, sexual violence, dating violence, or stalking who 
is absent for more than one hundred twenty (120) days may still be considered a 
Family member based on documentation that the victim is expected to return to 
the Family in a reasonable time if the victim provides to DCHA documentation 
that meets the requirements of § 4907.12.
4907.10
If a Family or Family member participant has been a victim of domestic violence, 
dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking by an individual, the participant may 
port to another PHA jurisdiction in violation of the lease as explained in Chapter 
55 of this title of the DCMR so long as the Family has complied with all other 
obligations of the HCVP.
4907.11
If a Family or Family member participant who has been the victim of domestic 
violence, dating violence, stalking, or sexual assault moves in violation of the 
lease, DCHA shall not terminate assistance or deny a Family’s request to move 
under portability if the move was related to the act of domestic violence, dating 
violence,  stalking,  or  sexual  assault.  The  portability  regulations  outlined  in 
Chapter 55 of this title shall apply.
4907.12
