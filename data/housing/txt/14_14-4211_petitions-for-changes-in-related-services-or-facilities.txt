PETITIONS FOR CHANGES IN RELATED SERVICES OR 
FACILITIES
4211.1
A housing provider who has changed or proposes to change any related service or 
facility provided to a rental unit or housing accommodation may petition the Rent 
Administrator for a rent adjustment under § 211 of the Act (D.C. Official Code 
§ 42-3502.11) (“services or facilities petition”) to reflect the monthly value of the 
change.
4211.2
No mandatory fee shall be charged for any service or facility without approval 
under this section, and any service or facility for which a mandatory fee is 
charged shall be deemed a related service or facility and shall not be reduced or 
eliminated without approval under this section.
4211.3
A housing provider may add or increase related services or facilities at any time 
without a rent increase for any rental unit without waiving the right to file a 
corresponding services or facilities petition for a rent adjustment at a later date, 
and may reduce or eliminate the service or facility if no corresponding rent 
increase has been implemented; provided, that if a related service or facility has 
been provided for three (3) or more years without a corresponding petition for a 
rent adjustment, the service or facility shall be deemed to be included in the rent.
4211.4
A housing provider shall not eliminate or substantially reduce related services or 
facilities provided without prior approval of a services or facilities petition or 
reduce or eliminate a related service or facility that is required by law, including 
by the Housing Regulations.  If related services or facilities decrease by accident, 
inadvertence, or neglect by a housing provider and are not promptly restored, the 
housing provider shall promptly reduce the rent for an affected rental unit by an 
amount that reflects the monthly value of the change in related services or 
facilities, until the service or facility is restored or a services or facilities petition 
authorized the reduction.
4211.5
A tenant may file a petition, in accordance with § 4214, if a housing provider fails 
to comply with §  and does not promptly restore the related service or facility to 
the previous level or implement a corresponding reduction in the rent charged. 
The tenant may be awarded a rent refund, or rent rollback if the violation is 
ongoing, if the tenant proves:
(a)
That the reduction or elimination of the related service or facility was 
substantial, which includes substantial violations of the Housing 
Regulations provided in § 4216.2;
(b)
The dates on which the related service or facility was first reduced or 
eliminated and the duration of the reduction or elimination; and

(f)
The proposed rent adjustment fairly and reasonably reflects the monthly 
value of the change in related services or facilities.
4211.8
The monthly value of changes in related services or facilities shall be determined 
as an adjustment to the rent charged for a rental unit in consideration of the 
following:
(a)
The probable cost to a tenant of obtaining alternate services or facilities 
comparable to those increased or reduced by the housing provider;
(b)
The actual or foreseeable operating cost to the housing provider of the 
related services or facilities proposed to be changed; or
(c)
The fair market value of comparable related services or facilities.
4211.9
The monthly value of changes in related services or facilities shall not include or 
reflect the cost to the housing provider to make any related capital improvements, 
whether or not the housing provider could or does file a petition pursuant to 
§ 4210 to recover those costs.
4211.10
After determining, in accordance with § 4208.5, that a services or facilities 
petition has been properly filed, the Rent Administrator shall transmit the petition 
to the Office of Administrative Hearings within ten (10) business days.
4211.11
A tenant or tenant association that appears pursuant to § 4208.11 may contest 
whether the services or facilities petition should be approved or denied, in whole 
or in part, based on the following issues:
(a)
Whether the petition must be denied for any reason provided in § ;
(b)
Whether the proposed monthly value of the change is fair or reasonable 
based on the factors provided in § ;

housing provider has all required business licenses;

Whether,  pursuant  to  § 4216.4,  substantial  violations  of  the  Housing 
Regulations existed on the date the services or facilities petition was filed 
and have not been abated at the time of a hearing on the services or 
facilities petition;

Whether the services or facilities petition was filed as a retaliatory action 
prohibited by § 502 of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-3505.02) and

exhaustion of any rights of appeal, but no earlier than twelve (12) months 
following any prior rent increase for that rental unit; provided, that the change in 
related services or facilities shall be implemented prior to the rent increase.

forfeiture of the authorization in accordance with § 4204.9(e).

final order approving a services or facilities petition may be implemented at any 
time  after  its  approval;  provided,  that  if  the  final  order  provides  for  a
