The official record of a proceeding shall consist of the following:

The final order and any other orders or notices issued by the Rent 
Administrator or the Office of Administrative Hearings;
(b)
The recordings and transcripts, if any, of all hearings before the 
Administrative Law Judge;
(c)
All papers and exhibits offered into evidence, if any, at the hearing before 
the Administrative Law Judge, including any files and documents found in

If it is determined, on the Commission’s initiative or by motion of a party, that 
any material part of the record is not complete, omitted from, or misstated in the 
certified record, the parties may at any time, by stipulation, supply any omission 
from the record or correct a misstatement, or any Commissioner may direct the 
Clerk to obtain a recertified copy of the official record to supply the omission or 
correct the misstatement.  Recertification of the record of a case shall not change 
the scheduled time for parties to file briefs unless the Commissioner determines
