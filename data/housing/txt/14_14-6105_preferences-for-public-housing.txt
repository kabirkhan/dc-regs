PREFERENCES FOR PUBLIC HOUSING
6105.1
At the time of application, applicants self-certify their preference. Verification of 
a preference is not required until an applicant reaches the top of the waiting list. 
Applicants will be required to provide verification that they meet the preference 
as part of the eligibility determination process.
6105.2
The granting of a preference does not guarantee admission to public housing. 
Preferences are used merely to establish the order of placement on the waiting list. 
Every applicant for public housing or the Housing Choice Voucher Program must 
also meet DCHA's Applicant Selection Criteria outlined in Section 6109 below.
(a)

mixed population properties:
Preference #1: Elderly Families and/or Families with a 
household member with disability
Preference #2: Near Elderly Families
Preference #3: All Other Families
(B)
No individual shall be considered a person with disabilities, 
for purposes of eligibility for public housing or RAD under 
this Title, solely on the basis of any current drug or alcohol 
dependence.

general and/or mixed-population properties will be selected from 
qualified  applicants  in  the  Emergency  Category.  Emergency 
Category is defined in 14 DCMR Section 5705.
(b)
If there are no applicants on the waiting list that qualify for the Emergency 
Category, otherwise eligible applicants will be selected for admission.
(c)
The admission systems described above will work in combination with 
requirements to match the characteristics of applicant families to the type 
of units available, including units for targeted populations, e.g., elderly, 
disabled. The ability to provide public housing for qualified applicants 
will depend on the availability of appropriately sized public housing or 
RAD units.
6105.3
The DCHA shall select families from the waiting list in the Emergency Category 
by date and time of application, except when a situation is a federally or locally 
declared natural disaster or civil disturbance, in which case the Executive Director 
has  the  discretion  to  waive  date  and  time  of  application  in  selection.  Any 
determination by the Executive Director to waive the date and time of application 
must be in writing stating the maximum number of applications that will be 
selected under these provisions or any limits on time for the waiver, with such 
waiver being approved for form and legal sufficiency by General Counsel and 
published in the D.C. Register.
6105.4
The preferences for admission to the Housing Choice Voucher Program are found 
in the DCHA's Administrative Plan for the Section 8 Certificate and Housing 
Voucher Programs.
