NOTICES OF VIOLATION, INFRACTION, OR ORDER
9907.1
The Department may issue a notice of violation, notice of infraction, or order on a 
respondent imposing a civil fine or other civil penalty, whenever the Department 
has reasonable grounds to believe the respondent is in violation of this 
chapter.
9907.2
The Department may refer violations of this chapter to the Office of the Attorney 
General.
9907.3
For purposes of determining whether a host is in violation of this chapter, if any 
part of a listing for a short-term rental claims or suggests that a short-term rental 
guest will have exclusive use of the host’s entire residence during the guest’s stay, 
this shall serve as prima facie evidence that the short-term rental is a vacation 
rental, notwithstanding the type of license endorsement actually issued.  A host 
may, however, note in a listing that a short-term rental guest will have exclusive 
access of a certain portion of the property (i.e., an English basement, or a defined 
space within the overall property).
