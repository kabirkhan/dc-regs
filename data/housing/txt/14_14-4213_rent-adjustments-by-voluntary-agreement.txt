for any rental unit or inequitable treatment of specific tenants or rental

4213.22
For  the  purposes  of  §  4213.21(c),  the  reasonableness  of  any  proposed  rent 
adjustments for a rental unit in a Final Voluntary Agreement shall be determined 
in consideration of the following factors, as may be relevant:

related  services  or  facilities  in  proportion  to  the  amount  of  the  rent 
adjustments and to the rents for comparable rental units;
(b)
Provisions, if any, for capital improvements, the performance of deferred, 
ordinary maintenance or repairs, and the status or establishment of any

defined in § 4209.8;

will have a rent burden greater than thirty percent (30%) of their monthly 
household incomes;
(h)
Other terms and conditions agreed to by the housing provider and tenants, 
as required to be filed under § 4213.3(d); and
(i)
The justification for any proposed disparities between tenants or classes of 
tenants or rental units in the percentage by which the rents will be 
adjusted.
4213.23

Code § 42-3502.24(i)) and § 4215.2 of this chapter or have previously filed an 
application to register for protected status under § 4215, shall not be deemed 
inequitable or unjustified disparities in rent adjustments.
4213.24

thirty (30) days in accordance with § 4213.19, the Rent Administrator, within five

business days of its issuance, be appealed to the Commission in accordance with § 
3802 by any party to the case that is aggrieved by the final order.  In accordance 
with § 3805, a housing provider shall not implement a rent adjustment authorized 
by a final order while an appeal of that order is pending before the Commission.
4213.30
A rent adjustment authorized by a final order approving an application under this 
section shall be implemented for an affected rental unit in accordance with § 4205 
within twelve (12) months of the date of the order, including the exhaustion of 
any rights of appeal, but no earlier than twelve (12) months following any prior 
rent increase for that rental unit; provided, that any changes in related services or 
facilities shall be implemented prior to the rent increase and the rent increase shall 
not be deemed first-authorized until all changes are implemented, and that if the 
work to make any capital improvement renders the unit uninhabitable beyond the 
expiration of time, the rent surcharge may be implemented when the unit is 
reoccupied.  Failure to implement the adjustment within twelve (12) months will 
result in forfeiture of the authorization in accordance with § 4204.9(e).
4213.31
If a Final Voluntary Agreement contains any terms to alter the provision or levels 
of related services or facilities at a housing accommodation, within thirty (30)

Registration/Claim of Exemption Form in accordance with § 4103.1(c).
4213.32
A tenant of an affected rental unit who receives notice of an application filed 
under this section and who fails to contest the application shall not at a later date 
contest or challenge, by tenant petition under § 4214, an order of the Rent

agreement, a tenant or tenant association may file a tenant petition challenging the 
rent adjustment implemented or provision or levels of related service or facility 
pursuant to the voluntary agreement, in accordance with § 4214.6(f).
