4209.31
Prior  to  the  issuance  of  an  Audit  Report  and  Proposed  Order,  the  Rent 
Administrator  shall  issue  an  order  staying  or  extending  the  time before  a

section  regarding  the  completion  of  the  Hardship  Petition  Form  or

order, the Rent Administrator may dismiss the hardship petition.

(d)
Whether any operating expense is extraordinary and should therefore be 
excluded or averaged over multiple years, or is capital in nature and 
should therefore be amortized or depreciated over its useful life;
(e)
The existence of a valid registration statement or business license for the 
housing accommodation;
(f)
Whether, as provided by § 4216.4, substantial violations of the Housing

not been abated on the date of a hearing on the hardship petition; 
(g)
Whether the hardship petition was filed as a retaliatory action prohibited 
by § 502 of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-3505.02) and § 4303 of this 
title; or
(h)
Any other violation of the requirements provided by §§ 206(c) or 212 of 
the Act (D.C. Official Code §§ 42-3502.06(c) or 42-3502.12) or this 
section.
4209.36
After  exceptions  and  objections  have  been  filed  and  a  hardship  petition 
transferred to the Office of Administrative Hearings, the Administrative Law 
Judge may issue an order containing findings of fact or conclusions of law as to 
any issue of error identified by the parties or Administrative Law Judge with 
respect to the Audit Report and remanding the hardship petition to the Rent 
Administrator for a revised Audit Report.
4209.37
Within ninety (90) days of the filing of a hardship petition that claims a negative 
net income in accordance with § , if the Office of Administrative Hearings has not 
issued a final order approving or denying the hardship petition, in whole or in 
part, or if such an order is stayed by an appeal to the Commission or the District 
of Columbia Court of Appeals, the housing provider may implement a conditional 
rent surcharge for each affected rental unit; provided, that any extension of time 
ordered pursuant to §  shall be added to the number of days after which the 
housing provider may implement the conditional rent surcharge.
4209.38

Hearings, the Administrative Law Judge may issue a provisional order approving

expiration of time under § ; provided, that the Administrative Law Judge may 
Housing
14 DCMR § 4209
District of Columbia Municipal Regulations
 
issue an order extending the time provided by §  if he or she determines that the 
housing provider is responsible for any unreasonable delay in holding a hearing.
4209.40
A conditional rent surcharge pursuant § , if allowed, shall be implemented in 
accordance with §§ 4205.4 and 4205.5, and copies of the sample notice of rent 
increase and affidavit of service required by § 4205.4(d) shall be transmitted by 
the Rental Accommodations Division to the Office of Administrative Hearings 
and entered into the record of the pending hardship petition.
4209.41
A tenant may contest the implementation of a conditional rent surcharge under § , 
but not the merits of the related, pending hardship petition, by filing a separate 
tenant petition with the Rent Administrator pursuant to § 4214.  In the discretion 
of the Office of Administrative Hearings, a tenant petition on a conditional 
surcharge and the related, pending hardship petition may be consolidated or 
separately adjudicated in order to provide expedited resolution regarding the 
current rents charged in the housing accommodation.
4209.42
If a conditional rent surcharge has been implemented pursuant to § , and a final 
order of the Rent Administrator, the Office of Administrative Hearings, or a 
decision by the Commission in an appeal approves only in part or denies the 
related hardship petition, the housing provider shall immediately implement a rent 
rollback in the amount by which the conditional surcharge exceeds the approved 
amount, if any, of the hardship petition, and the housing provider shall, within 
twenty one (21) days, refund to each affected tenant any excess rent demanded, 
received, or charged while the hardship petition has been pending, unless a tenant 
elects in writing within fourteen (14) days to receive the balance owed as a rent 
credit.  Any agreement to receive a rent credit shall contain an express, written, 
knowing waiver of the right to receive a rent refund.  A final order approving in 
part or denying a hardship petition shall constitute a final order to pay any rent 
refund and implement any rent rollback required by this section.
4209.43
Any rent surcharge that is authorized by a final order approving a hardship 
petition shall be implemented in accordance with § 4205 within twelve (12) 
months of the date on which the order becomes final, including the exhaustion of 
any rights of appeal, but no earlier than twelve (12) months following any prior 
rent increase for an affected rental unit, other than a conditional increase pursuant 
to this section.  Failure to implement the rent adjustment within twelve (12) 
months will result in forfeiture of the authorization for adjustment in accordance 
with § 4204.9(e).
