REPAYMENT AGREEMENTS GENERALLY
5602.1
A Repayment Agreement is a document entered into between DCHA and a Head 
of  Household  or  an  owner  who  owes  a  debt  to  DCHA.  It  is  similar  to  a 
promissory note, but contains more details regarding the nature of the debt, the 
terms of payment, special provisions, and the remedies available to DCHA upon 
default of the Agreement.
5602.2
The minimum monthly payment under a repayment agreement shall be negotiated 
on a case-by-case basis between DCHA and the participant Family or owner.
5602.3
The goal of any repayment agreement shall be to establish reasonable monthly 
payments such that the participant can remain in the program so long as he or she 
complies with the terms of the repayment agreement.   
5602.4
The circumstances in which DCHA may decline to enter into a Repayment 
Agreement include, but are not limited to, any of the following:
(a)
If the participant Family or owner already has a Repayment Agreement in 
place; 
(b)
If DCHA determines that the Family or owner:
(1)
committed program fraud; 
(2)
intentionally withheld information; or
(3)
intentionally provided false information; or
(c)
If the Family already has a Repayment Agreement in place and incurs an 
additional debt to DCHA, any old debts to DCHA shall be paid in full 
before DCHA enters into a new Repayment Agreement.
