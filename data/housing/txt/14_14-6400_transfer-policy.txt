TRANSFER POLICY
6400.1
It shall be the policy of the District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA) to 
transfer tenants from one dwelling unit to another to alleviate conditions of 
hardship  caused  by  physical  conditions  or  to  address changed  family 
circumstances. Transfers may result from actions mandated by DCHA or result 
from requests by its tenants.  To facilitate such transfer, DCHA may offer units in 
its traditional public housing or in its RAD inventory, excluding RAD units 
within any Private Mixed Finance Project (as defined under Title 14, Chapter 57, 
Subsection 5705.1).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, tenants residing within any 
Private Mixed Finance Project may also be transferred within or between any 
Private Mixed Finance Project in accordance with any applicable regulatory and 
operating agreement or RAD control agreement.
6400.2
It is DCHA’s policy that transfers will be  made without regard to race, color, 
national origin, sex, religion, or familial status. Residents can be transferred to 
accommodate a disability.
6400.3
Residents will receive one offer of a transfer. Refusal of that offer without good 
cause will result in lease termination for mandatory transfers or the removal of the 
household from the transfer list for tenant requested transfers. The good cause 
standard applicable to new admissions shall apply to transfers. Good cause may 
include refusal of a unit that does not meet the VAWA “safe unit” standard based 
on the incident of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking 
as defined in Section 6099. 
 
6400.4
Transfers will be processed by the Director of Housing Management. Residents 
may apply to their resident manager for a transfer, but all paperwork, verifications 
and unit assignments shall be made by the Director of Housing Management.
6400.5
Mandatory  transfers  initiated  by  DCHA  shall  take  precedence  over  new 
admissions. New admissions shall take precedence over transfers requested by 
tenants. Except as noted in § 6402.8, DCHA shall assign vacant units that it does 
not need to house  mandatory transferees, using a ratio of five units for initial 
occupancy by applicants on the DCHA waiting list, to one unit for a tenant from 
the DCHA Transfer List.
6400.6
Upon acceptance of the new dwelling unit, the Lessee must execute a new 
Dwelling Lease. All causes of action of any nature whatsoever available to 
DCHA at the previous Leased Premises governed by the Dwelling Lease, shall be 
automatically transferred to, and actionable by, DCHA at the new unit after 
transfer, whether such transfer is mandatory or voluntary. This regulation does not 
waive any statute of limitations otherwise applicable to such claims.
