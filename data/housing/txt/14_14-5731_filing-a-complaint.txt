FILING A COMPLAINT
5731.1
Any resident of or applicant for a RAD Covered Project may file with DCHA or 
the Project Owner a complaint requesting an administrative determination of his 
or her rights for any dispute he or she may have with respect to a Project Owner’s 
action or failure to act in accordance with the individual’s lease or the contract 
administrator’s action or failure to act in accordance with RAD PBV requirements 
that adversely affect the resident’s rights, obligations, welfare, or status.
5731.2
The complaint shall be mailed or personally presented either orally or in writing 
to the DCHA Office of Fair Hearings or to the office of the property in which the 
complainant resides during normal office hours, but not later than thirty-five (35) 
calendar days after the DCHA or Project Owner’s act or  failure to  act that 
constitutes the basis for the grievance.  For a complaint concerning termination of 
assistance by DCHA, a participant must request an informal hearing within thirty-
five (35) calendar days of the date of the issuance of the recommendation for 
termination of assistance by DCHA.

action or relief requested. Upon request, DCHA or office of the property in which 
the complainant resides will assist a complainant in putting his or her complaint in 
writing.

Upon receipt of the complaint, the DCHA Office of Fair Hearings or the office of 
the property in which the complainant resides shall provide the complainant with 
a  receipt  indicating  a  complaint  was  filed  and  information  explaining  the 
complainant’s  right  to a  fair  hearing  and  outlining  the  RAD  Grievance 
Procedures. If the complaint is filed at the office of the property in which the
