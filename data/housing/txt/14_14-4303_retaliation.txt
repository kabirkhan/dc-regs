Contacting appropriate officials of the District government, either orally in 
the presence of a witness or in writing, concerning existing violations of 
the Housing Regulations in the rental unit the tenant occupies or

would render the rental unit or housing accommodation in noncompliance 
with the Housing Regulations;

reasonable notice to the housing provider, either orally in the presence of a 
witness or in writing, of a violation of the Housing Regulations;

Bringing legal action against the housing provider.

action was taken without retaliatory intent.

Where a housing provider is found to have violated § 4303.1, the Office of 
Administrative Hearings may order the housing provider, in addition to any other
