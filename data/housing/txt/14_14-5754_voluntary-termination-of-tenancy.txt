members, guests as well as all others defined as any person under the Participant's 
control or on the Leased Premises with Participant's consent; including but not 
limited to, any individuals occupying or using the Leased Premises for any 
purpose with actual or implied consent of the Participant(hereinafter referred to 
collectively  as  "others"),  vacate  the  Leased  Premises  on  or  before  the  date 
specified in Participant's written notice.

The Participant shall leave the Leased Premises in as clean and good condition as 
Participant received at the start of Lessee's occupancy; wear and tear excepted; 
and return all keys and all other entry devices to the Project Owner.

If the Participant is no longer in occupancy of the unit or is deceased, a remaining 
household member, or another adult identified in § 5754.5(c) below, must notify 
the Authority of the Participant’s  death or departure within fourteen (14) days of 
the date the Participant  vacates the Leased Premises or dies. Within thirty (30)

Notice to Vacate the premises, whichever is later, in order to sustain continued 
occupancy for the remaining household members at the Leased Premises, the 
remaining household member or other adult must submit a written application to 
become head of household. Details on the application process and exclusions 
from this rule are as follows:
(a)
This subsection does not apply if the head of household vacates the unit 
pursuant to the issuance of a notice to correct or vacate or a notice to 
vacate.  In  such  circumstances,  the  remaining  family  members  must 
vacate the unit. If the remaining family members do not vacate the unit, 
they shall be deemed unauthorized occupants;

(b)
The  applicant  to  be  made  Participant,  and  if  applicable,  the  other 
remaining Household Members must be eligible for continued occupancy 
and not be in serious violation of the material terms of the Dwelling 
Lease. DCHA will screen the application in accordance with federal law 
and regulations as well as DCHA's admissions and occupancy policies 
and regulations. Applicant(s) will be notified in writing of the disposition 
of the application:
(1)
If the application is approved, the new Participant shall enter into 
a new lease agreement with the Project Owner within seven (7) 
working days of the date of approval of the application;
(2)
Any balance on the rental account existing prior to a remaining 
household member becoming the Participant is the responsibility 
of the newly designated Participant as head of household. Any 
obligations for rent, causes of action arising under the original 
Lease, stipulations of settlement, consent judgments, judgments, 
or repayment agreements of the prior Participant shall be deemed 
part of the new Dwelling Lease and tenancy and shall be the 
responsibility  of  the  new  Participant  designated  as  head  of 
household and actionable against such new Participant; or
(3)
If the applicant and other remaining Household Members are not 
approved to continue to occupy the Leased Premises, and such 
remaining  members  do  not  vacate,  they  will  be  deemed 
unauthorized occupants and thus occupying premises without the 
consent of DCHA and the Project Owner and shall be subject to 
eviction  by  the  Project  Owner.  The  applicant  may  file  a 
grievance  regarding  the  denial  of  his  or  her  application  in 
accordance with DCHA’s grievance procedures; and
(c)
If there are no remaining adult household members, or none who are able 
to serve as head of household, but the unit continues to be occupied by 
household members who are minor children and/or adults unable to serve 
as head of household, then an adult who is not listed on the lease may 
apply to become Participant and Head of Household. The following shall 
apply under these circumstances:
(1)
The applicant to be Participant must produce evidence of a care 
giving relationship with the remaining minor children or disabled 
adults. Such documentation may include, but is not limited to, 
court order; notarized authorization from the children's legal 
guardian; school or medical records; public benefit records; and 
sworn  statements  from  medical,  legal,  or  social  service 
professionals;

(2)
Where the remaining family members are minors, the applicant 
to be Lessee must either (i) obtain Custodial Power of Attorney; 
or (ii) commence legal proceedings to obtain legal guardianship 
or custody of the minor children. So long as such proceeding is 
pending, and the applicant has produced evidence of a caregiving 
relationship, and meets DCHA's other screening criteria, DCHA 
shall consider the applicant to be eligible to be Participant and 
Head of Household;
(3)
In the case of (c)(2), above, the applicant's eligibility to be 
Participant  and  Head  of  Household  is  contingent  on  legal 
proceedings pending or being resolved in favor of the applicant. 
If a court of competent jurisdiction denies the applicant's petition 
for custody or guardianship, no appeal is pending, and the appeal 
period has expired, DCHA will determine the applicant ineligible 
to be Head of Household and DCHA and the Project Owner may 
issue a Notice to Vacate. In that event, another remaining adult 
household member may submit an application to be Participant 
and Head of Household within thirty (30) days of the issuance of 
the Notice, and the DCHA will process such application in 
accordance with the requirements of this section; and
(4)
Where more than one adult have competing claims to become 
Participant  and  Head  of  Household  as  caregivers  of  the 
remaining minor children, DCHA shall follow the ruling of a 
court  of  competent  jurisdiction  regarding  the  custody  or 
guardianship of the children.
5754.6
The Participant shall be liable for rent until the earlier of the time the Project 
Owner has taken possession of the Unit, or such time as all of the following are 
completed:
(a)
The proper written notice has been given;
(b)
The required vacate forms are completed with the assistance of DCHA if 
necessary;
(c)
The keys are turned in; and any other entry devices; and
(d)
Participant and all household members, guests as well as all others defined 
as any person under the Participant's control or on the Leased Premises 
with Participant's consent; including but not limited to, any individuals 
occupying or using the Leased Premises for any purpose with actual or 
implied consent of the Participant (hereinafter referred to collectively as 
"others"), have vacated the Leased Premises.
