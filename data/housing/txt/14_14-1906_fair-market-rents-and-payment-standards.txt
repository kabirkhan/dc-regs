FAIR MARKET RENTS AND PAYMENT STANDARDS
1906.1
DCHA shall establish fair market rents on an annual basis using the annual fair market rents 
established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for the new 
construction and substantial rehabilitation Section 8 Housing Assistance Program for the 
Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area; provided, however, that the following factors may be 
used by DCHA in establishing fair market rents:
(a)
If HUD does not establish fair market rents for unit sizes above four (4) bedrooms, 
DCHA may establish fair market rents for larger units by adding fifteen percent 
(15%) to the fair market rent for a four (4) bedroom unit for each additional bedroom;
(b)
If HUD does not establish annual fair market rents for units designed for the elderly 
or handicapped, DCHA may approve fair market rents at a level of five percent (5%) 
above other fair market rents established by HUD, not to exceed two (2) bedrooms 
for the elderly;
(c)
If HUD does not establish annual fair market rents for Single Room Occupancy 
(SRO) housing, the fair market rent shall range from seventy-five percent (75%) to 
one hundred percent (100%) of the 0-bedroom fair market rent established by HUD; 
and
(d)
If HUD does not update its fair market rents for new construction and substantial 
rehabilitation annually, DCHA may establish fair market rents for the period that 
HUD has not established fair market rents.

1906.3
In establishing fair market rents, if DCHA determines that the rents established in accordance 
with § 1906.1 do not accurately reflect fair market rents in the District of Columbia, DCHA may 
make adjustments to the fair market rents established by HUD.
1906.4
Fair market rents established by DCHA under § 1906.1 or § 1906.3 shall be published as a rule 
for comment in the D.C. Register, except that rents established under § 1906.3 shall also be 
subject to the following requirements before the proposed rulemaking can be published as final 
and in effect:
(a)
The proposed adjusted fair market rents shall be submitted with a resolution for 
approval to the Council of the District of Columbia for a forty-five (45) day period of 
review, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays and days of Council recess; and
(b)
If the Council does not approve or disapprove the proposed resolution, in whole or in 
part, within the review period, the proposed resolution shall be deemed approved.
1906.5
DCHA shall use the Fair Market Rents as a ceiling for establishing, at least annually, the 
Payment Standard Schedules used to compute Tenant Assistance Payments as described in § 
1908 of this chapter. Payment Standard Schedules shall be determined based on consideration of 
the following:
(a)
Rents, and all maintenance, management, and other services that would be paid to 
obtain privately owned decent, safe and standard rental housing of modest non-luxury 
nature with suitable amenities in the District of Columbia;
(b)
Data concerning rental rates for District of Columbia housing available from the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development, the U.S. Census Bureau, or other 
sources;
(c)
Data concerning rental rates for newly constructed or rehabilitated housing; and
(d)
Variations necessary for units of different sizes and types (including SRO units) with 
differentials for new, rehabilitated, and existing units.
1906.6
Payment Standard Schedules shall be published in the D.C. Register.
1906.7
The Director of DCHA, or his or her designee, may approve exception payment standards; 
provided, that the exception payment standards do not exceed the fair market rents in this chapter. 
The exceptions shall be authorized to obtain units needed to assist tenants who, due to family 
size, handicap, or other factors, would otherwise be unable to be assisted in a suitable unit.
