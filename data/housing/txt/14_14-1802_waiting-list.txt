WAITING LIST
1802.1
A preliminary finding of eligibility for admission to the Tenant Assistance Program shall be 
sufficient to place an applicant on the waiting list, in the manner described in § 1802.2.
1802.2
DCHA shall place each eligible applicant on the waiting list. DCHA shall use a random selection 
process to assign each eligible applicant an application number.

The waiting list shall be organized by unit size, applicant reference category, and application 
number.
1802.4
Applicants meeting the criteria for priority consideration under § 1803 shall be placed at the top 
of the waiting list within each unit size in application number order with priority over all other 
applicants requiring units of that same unit size.
1802.5
The waiting list shall be updated annually to remove from the waiting list those applicants who 
may no longer be interested in, or eligible for, the program and to ensure that those families who 
are still interested and eligible are in the appropriate place on the waiting list. If circumstances 
have changed such that the family requires a different unit size or different preference, the 
appropriate changes shall be made to the waiting list.

calendar days from the date of DCHA’s request.
1802.8
Applicants not returning the information requested, and those who respond and are found to be 
ineligible, shall be so notified and removed from the waiting list and placed in the ineligible files.
