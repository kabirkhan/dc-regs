GENERAL OVERVIEW
4200.1
This chapter implements the Rent Stabilization Program, established by Title II of 
the Rental Housing Act of 1985 (“Act”), by regulating rent adjustments for 
covered rental units.  The Rent Stabilization Program restricts when rent may be 
increased and the amount by which it may be increased at any one time.  A 
housing provider may decrease rent at any time, or a rent decrease may be 
required by the Rent Stabilization Program.  Notice of any rent adjustment must 
be filed with the Rental Accommodations Division.
4200.2
Prior to August 5, 2006, the Rent Stabilization Program regulated rents primarily 
by establishing a “rent ceiling” for each covered rental unit and further by limiting 
increases in the rent charged.  Pursuant to the Rent Control Reform Amendment 
Act of 2006 (D.C. Law 16-145; 53 DCR 6688 (June 23, 2006)), rent ceilings are 
abolished, except that:
(a)
A  housing  provider  may  increase  the  rent  for  a  rental  unit  by 
implementing any previously unused adjustment to the rent ceiling of the 
unit pursuant to a petition or voluntary agreement that was approved by 
the Rent Administrator prior to, or for which approval was pending on, 
August 5, 2006; and
(b)
Any petition or voluntary agreement for which approval remains pending 
in any proceeding under the Act shall be decided in accordance with the 
provisions of the Act and this chapter in effect at the time the proceeding 
was initiated.
4200.3
The Rent Stabilization Program covers all rental units in the District of Columbia 
except those rental units that are:
(a)
Exempt from the Rent Stabilization Program by § 205(a) of the Act (D.C. 
Official Code § 42-3502.05(a)) and § 4106 of this title; or
(b)
Excluded from the scope of the Act by § 205(e) of the Act (D.C. Official 
Code § 42-3502.05(e)) and § 4105 of this title.
4200.4
The initial maximum, lawful rent for each rental unit covered by the Rent 
Stabilization  Program  shall  be  the  amount  established  in  accordance  with 
§§ 4201, 4202, or 4203, as applicable.
4200.5
The rent charged to a tenant for a covered rental unit shall be filed by the housing 
provider with the Rental Accommodations Division, and the amount of rent 
charged on file shall be updated in accordance with § 4204 following any rent 
adjustment, including when the amount of rent charged is reduced.

As provided in § 4205, the rent for a covered rental unit may be increased no 
more than once every twelve (12) months, except in the case of a vacancy 
adjustment, and may be increased at any given time by no more than the amount 
allowed by one (1) authorized basis for rent adjustment provided by the Rent 
Stabilization Program.

adjustments, which are described in detail in the corresponding sections of this 
chapter:
(a)
For rent adjustments that do not require prior administrative approval:
(1)
The annual adjustment of general applicability published by the 
Commission, based on the consumer price index or Social Security 
COLA, in § 4206; and
(2)
An adjustment upon a vacancy in a rental unit, in § 4207; and
(b)
For rent adjustments that require prior administrative approval by petition 
or application:
(1)
Rent surcharges based on claims of hardship, in § 4209;
(2)
Rent surcharges based on the cost of capital improvements, in 
§ 4210;
(3)
Rent adjustments based on changes in related services or facilities, 
in § 4211;
(4)
Rent surcharges based on substantial rehabilitations, in § 4212; and
(5)
Rent adjustments based on voluntary agreements, in § 4213.
4200.8
Each affected tenant shall be notified of and have an opportunity to contest a 
pending petition or application for approval of a rent adjustment of the types 
listed in § 4200.7(b), in accordance with § 4208 and the applicable section of this 
chapter for the type of adjustment requested.
4200.9
A petition or application for a rent adjustment of the types listed in § 4200.7(b) 
may  be  contested  on  the  grounds  that  an  affected  rental  unit  or  housing 
accommodation is not in substantial compliance with the Housing Regulations, as 
provided in § 4216, and shall not be approved unless the non-compliance has been 
abated  at  the  time  of  an  evidentiary  hearing  on  the  petition,  except  that  a 
substantial rehabilitation surcharge may be approved if it will abate all substantial 
violations.

4200.10
The rent for a rental unit shall not be increased based on an otherwise-authorized 
rent adjustment, including a substantial rehabilitation surcharge, if the unit or the 
housing accommodation of which it is a part is not in substantial compliance with 
the Housing Regulations, as provided in § 4216, on the effective date of the rent 
increase.
4200.11
Notice of all rent increases shall be served on the affected tenant and filed with 
the Rent Administrator, in accordance with § 4205.
4200.12
Authorization for a rent adjustment shall be valid as follows:
(a)
Except for vacancy adjustments, authorization shall expire twelve (12) 
months after either the published effective date of the annual adjustment 
of general applicability or the date an order of the Rent Administrator or 
Office of Administrative Hearings approving the adjustment becomes 
final, as applicable;
(b)
A vacancy adjustment shall be implemented only at the time a new 
tenancy begins after a vacancy occurs, in accordance with § 4207.4;
(c)
Failure to implement a rent adjustment within the time allowed shall result 
in the forfeiture of the authorization for the rent adjustment, in accordance 
with § 4204.9; and
(d)
The prohibition on implementation of multiple rent adjustments within a 
twelve (12) month period, as provided by § 4200.6, shall not excuse the 
failure, or extend the allowable time, to implement a rent adjustment.
4200.13
A tenant may contest any rent adjustment for his or her rental unit, or an 
unauthorized reduction or elimination of related services or facilities, by filing a 
petition with the Rent Administrator within three (3) years of the effective date of 
the rent increase or the reduction or elimination of related services or facilities, in 
accordance with § 4214.
4200.14
If a tenant prevails in a petition filed under § 4214, the tenant may be awarded a 
refund of rent demanded or received by the housing provider in excess of the 
lawful rent for the rental unit, and the housing provider may be ordered to reduce 
the rent going forward (a rent rollback), in accordance with § 4217.
4200.15
When  a  petition  or  application  before  the  Rent  Administrator  requires  an 
evidentiary hearing on the record as provided by this chapter, jurisdiction over the 
matter shall be transferred to the Office of Administrative Hearings.  An appeal 
from a final order of the Office of Administrative Hearings may be filed with the 
Commission in accordance with Chapter 38 of this title.
