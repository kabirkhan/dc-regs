ABATEMENT FOR HOUSING QUALITY INSPECTION 
FAILURES
5328.1
When DCHA determines that an assisted unit fails to meet Housing Quality 
standards as described in 14 DCMR §§ 5320, et seq., and the owner has been 
given an opportunity to correct the problem(s) and does not do so within the time 
frame established by DCHA, the rent for the unit shall be abated. 
 
5328.2
DCHA will notify the owner in the notice scheduling the re-inspection that if the 
unit fails the re-inspection, abatement may begin effective the first day of the 
following monthly accounting period. After the unit fails re-inspection, DCHA 
shall send the owner and participant Family a Contract Cancellation Notice, 
informing the owner and the participant of the date that the abatement was 
effective, and the date that the contract will be terminated if a third inspection is 
not passed.  
5328.3
The Contract Cancellation Notice shall also include information about legal 
service providers.
 
5328.4
The abatement period shall continue until the unit passes the Housing Abatement 
Compliance Inspection during the abatement period, or forty-five (45) days have 
expired  from  the  first  of  the  month  following  the  final  failed  inspection, 
whichever comes first.  
5328.5
The owner must request the Housing Abatement Compliance Inspection at least 
ten (10) business days prior to the date of the Contract Cancellation. The owner 
will be charged a fee for this third inspection. This fee must be paid before the 
hold on the HAP payments will be released.
 
5328.6
 If the owner fails to request a third and final inspection within forty-five (45) 
days of re-inspection, or the unit fails the third and final inspection the Contract 
shall terminate effective the date in the Notice pursuant to § 5329.2 or at the time 
of the final failure, whichever occurs later.
5328.7
If the unit passes final inspection, the HAP Contract shall not be terminated and 
HAP to the owner shall resume from the date of passed inspection. 
5328.8
In the event that DCHA makes overpayments when a unit should have been 
abated for HQS violations, DCHA shall make every attempt to recapture the 
overpayments.  The Family shall not be responsible to the owner for any part of 
DCHA’s portion of rent that is recaptured pursuant to this section.
5328.9
DCHA shall have up to one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the final 
failed inspection to begin to abate rent.
