INTRODUCTION TO CERTIFICATION
8400.1
DCHA’s rent subsidy programs are all predicated on supplementing the rent a Family of a certain 
size and gender composition can pay based on their Annual Income, adjusted for certain 
deductions and allowances, by paying a subsidy directly to the Owner. Certification of household 
income and family composition is critical to the accurate payment of the subsidy the Family is 
entitled to under the rules of each particular rent subsidy program. Unless otherwise noted in this 
Chapter or other Chapters about special housing programs in this Title 14, the certification and 
recertification of income and household composition is conducted under the provisions of this 
Title.
8400.2
There are four (4) types of certifications addressed herein below:
(a)
Initial certification at the time a voucher is initially issued;
(b)
Regular, periodic recertification, typically biennially, to ask the Family to certify and 
verify their income and household composition;
(c)
Transfer certification that occurs when a Family requests a transfer voucher under the 
portability or move provisions of the Administration Plan adopted pursuant to 24 
CFR § 982.54; and
(d)
Interim change recertification when the Family reports a change in between the 
periodic recertifications.
