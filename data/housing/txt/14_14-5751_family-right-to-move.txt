FAMILY RIGHT TO MOVE
5751.1
The Family may terminate its assisted lease at any time after the first year of 
occupancy, subject to the terms of the lease. The Family must provide thirty (30)-
day written notice of intent to vacate to the Property Manager of the RAD 
Covered Project (with a copy to DCHA), in accordance with the lease.
5751.2
Prior to or at the time of submitting a written notice of intent to vacate in 
accordance with Subsection 5751.1, the Family may request the opportunity for 
continued tenant-based rental assistance in the form of a tenant-based voucher 
under the Housing Choice Voucher Program.  To request a tenant-based voucher, 
the Family must submit a written request to the Property Manager of the RAD 
Covered Project.  Requests for continued tenant-based assistance will only be 
accepted  from  Families  that  meet  the  eligibility  requirements  of  Subsection 
5751.3.
5751.3
Tenants are eligible for continued tenant-based assistance, pursuant to Subsection 
5751.2, only if:
(a)
By the date requested for lease termination, the Family will have resided 
continuously in a RAD unit for at least one calendar year; and
(b)
On the date of request for continued tenant-based assistance pursuant to 
Section 5751.2, the Family is compliant with the terms and conditions of 
its lease, in accordance with Sections 5750.2 – 5750.4.
5751.4
If, on the date of receipt of a request submitted pursuant to Subsection 5751.2, (i) 
the Family is deemed eligible, in accordance with Subsection 5751.3, and (ii) a 
tenant-based voucher is available, DCHA shall offer the Family a tenant-based 
voucher.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  subject  to  applicable  federal 
requirements, if DCHA has already issued seventy-five percent (75%) of its total 
turnover vouchers in any single calendar year to Families of RAD units, DCHA 
shall place the Family on the RAD tenant-based voucher transfer list governed in 
accordance with Subsection 5751.6.
5751.5
If, at the time of receipt of a request submitted pursuant to Subsection 5751.2, (i) 
the Family is deemed eligible, in accordance with Subsection 5751.3, and (ii) a 
tenant-based voucher is not available, DCHA shall place the Family on the 
transfer list governed in accordance with Subsection 5751.6.
5751.6
Families requesting continued tenant-based assistance shall be prioritized based 
on the date on which the Family submitted its request for continued tenant-based 
assistance pursuant to § 5751.2.  Families on the RAD/PBV tenant-based voucher 
transfer list shall take priority over all other applicants for tenant-based vouchers. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to applicable federal requirements, once 
DCHA has issued seventy-five percent (75%) of its total turnover vouchers to 
Housing
14 DCMR § 5751
District of Columbia Municipal Regulations
 
Families of RAD units in any single calendar year, the priority given to Families 
placed on the RAD tenant-based voucher transfer list shall be governed by 
Chapter 76 of this title.
5751.7
If, at the time a Family reaches the top of the RAD tenant-based voucher transfer 
list, (i) a voucher is available and (ii) the Family has priority over all other 
applicants for tenant-based vouchers, based on the provisions of Subsection 
5751.6, DCHA shall offer the Family a tenant-based voucher.
5751.8
When DCHA is required to offer a Family a tenant-based voucher pursuant to 
Sections 5748 through 5752, DCHA shall provide written notice of its offer to the 
Family. The Family must submit a written acceptance of the tenant-based voucher 
to DCHA within thirty (30) days of the notice of offer.  Failure to submit a written 
acceptance of the voucher to DCHA within thirty (30) days of the notice of offer 
shall result in the Family being placed back on the RAD tenant-based voucher 
transfer list with a priority date set to the date of expiration of the notice of offer.
5751.9
If a Family timely accepts an offer to receive a tenant-based voucher, DCHA shall 
issue the Family a tenant-based voucher.  Notwithstanding, if at the time of 
acceptance, the Family is not compliant with the terms and conditions of its lease, 
in accordance with Subsections 5750.2 – 5750.4, DCHA may rescind its offer to 
issue a tenant-based voucher.
5751.10
Once issued, a tenant-based voucher shall expire one hundred eighty (180) days 
from the date of its issuance.
5751.11
If a Family locates a dwelling unit it wishes to lease, it shall be processed by 
DCHA as a new lease-up, including the following:
(a)
Provision of a lease-up packet;
(b)
Inspection of the new unit for compliance with HQS; and
(c)
Approval of the lease-up package and the lease terms, including the gross 
rent and the contract rent, subject to a rent reasonableness determination.
5751.12
If  the  tenant-based  voucher  expires  before  the  Family  initiates  the  lease-up 
process, pursuant to Subsection 5751.11:
(a)
The Family may continue its lease where it is currently leasing, provided 
that:
(1)
The Family has not yet given notice to terminate its lease to the 
owner; or
(2)
The Family has delivered to the owner a notice rescinding the

14 DCMR § 5751
District of Columbia Municipal Regulations
 
Family’s earlier termination notice with a copy of such notice 
simultaneously delivered to DCHA; and
(3)
The HAP Contract has not otherwise been terminated by DCHA.
(b)
The Family is not required to provide new lease-up or other documents to 
DCHA,  and  the  owner  shall  continue  to  receive  Housing  Assistance 
Payments as if the Participant had never requested the continued tenant-
based assistance.
(c)
The  Family’s  prior  Total  Tenant  Payment  continues  in  effect.
