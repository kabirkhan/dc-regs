PRE-APPLICATION
1801.1
For purposes of this section, the term “pre-application” means a prescribed form required to be 
completed by each person seeking admission to the Tenant Assistance Program. Each pre-
application shall be signed by the applicant and mailed to DCHA.
1801.2
The pre-application form shall provide to DCHA the information necessary to allow a 
preliminary determination of eligibility, unit size needed, and preferences in accordance with §§ 
1803, 1810 and 1813.
1801.3
DCHA shall receive and process pre-applications in a way that treats all applicants fairly and 
consistently.
1801.4
DCHA shall review each pre-application based only on the data contained in the signed pre-
application. This review shall be for completeness of all items on the prescribed pre-application 
form and for eligibility for admission based on pre-application information alone.
1801.5
The review for eligibility shall be based on applicant statements as to family size, family income 
and other information, without any independent verification.
1801.6
Illegible or incomplete pre-applications shall be rejected.
1801.7
Based on the review, DCHA shall make a preliminary finding of eligibility in accordance with 
the eligibility criteria described in § 1810, and assign a unit size to the family.
1801.8
A preliminary finding of eligibility shall be considered conditional, and eligibility determinations 
shall only be considered final after verification of information and a personal interview has 
occurred, as described in § 1812.
1801.9
DCHA may establish an expiration date for all pre-applications received during a pre-application 
time period. The effect of the expiration date shall be that any pre-application not elected and 
funded under the program prior to the established date shall expire and have no status for 
consideration under the program.
