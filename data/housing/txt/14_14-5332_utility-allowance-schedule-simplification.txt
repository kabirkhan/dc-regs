UTILITY ALLOWANCE SCHEDULE SIMPLIFICATION
5332.1
If the Family pays for some or all utilities, DCHA shall provide the Family with a 
utility  allowance.  The  allowances  are  based  on  actual  rates  and  average 
consumption estimates, not on a Family's actual energy consumption.  The utility 
allowance is given as a reduction in the Family’s portion of rent to be paid to the 
owner. 
5332.2
The Family’s share shall be the TTP minus an allowance for utilities based on 
income determinations as enumerated by 24 C.F.R. § 5.609 and 24 C.F.R. § 
5.611.
5332.3
DCHA shall review the Utility Allowance Schedule on an annual basis.  If a 
revision is needed, based on methods required by HUD, the Utility Allowance 
Schedule shall be revised. 
5332.4
Approved utility allowance schedule(s) shall be given to families along with their 
Housing Voucher.  The same schedule(s) shall be used by DCHA to record the 
actual allowance for the unit the Family selects if there are Family-paid utilities.
5332.5
Where the Utility Allowance exceeds the TTP of the Family, DCHA shall provide 
a Utility Reimbursement Payment on behalf of the Family each month. 
5332.6  
DCHA shall publish the utility schedule by bedroom sizes annually. DCHA shall 
also provide the utility allowance schedule to applicants at their initial briefing.
 
5332.7
A utility allowance shall be determined based upon the lesser of either:
(a)
Number of bedrooms; or
(b)
Voucher size; 
5332.8 
If any Family’s simplified utility allowance decreases by more than $25.00 and 
the decrease equals more than 10% of the household’s adjusted monthly income, 
the Family may request a hardship waiver. 
5332.9 
To qualify for the hardship waiver, the head of household must provide tenant 
paid utility bills, or other proof of tenant paid utility charges from the assisted unit 
from the previous six months to  demonstrate that  the  average monthly cost 
exceeds their new utility allowance. 
5332.10
Any request for a hardship must be in writing and received by DCHA within 
thirty-five  (35)  days  of  the  DCHA  notice  to  the  family  of  their  new  rent 
determination.

5332.11
A Family that can demonstrate hardship shall be provided with a one-time six 
month simplified utility allowance waiver and the utility allowance will be set at 
either the lower of:
(a)        the previous utility allowance; or 
(b)        Family’s average tenant paid utility bills from the past six months. 
5332.12 
At the end of the six month hardship period, the simplified utility allowance shall 
be applied.
