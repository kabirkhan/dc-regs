UTILITY ALLOWANCES
9106.1
Pursuant to 14 DCMR Section 5311, the allowances are based on actual rates and 
average consumption estimates, not on a family’s energy consumption. 
9106.2
The utility allowance is applied as follows: 
(a)
As  a reduction in the family’s portion of rent; 
(b)
As a subsidy allowance to the family through the use of a utility debit 
card; or
(c)
In some cases, both.
9106.3
When the family’s TTP minus the utility allowance plus any amount of gross rent 
above  the  payment  standard  exceeds  the  minimum  rent  of  $75,  the  utility 
allowance is given as a reduction in TTP.
9106.4
If, when the utility allowance is subtracted from the family’s TTP, the family rent 
to owner is less than the minimum rent of $75, the family is required to pay the 
minimum rent of $75, and the utility allowance shall be partially provided to the 
family through the use of a utility debit card.  The amount of the deposit on the 
utility reimbursement debit card shall be the total utility allowance minus the 
difference between the TTP and the minimum rent of $75.
