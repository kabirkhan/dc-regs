LAWFUL RENT UPON TERMINATION OF EXEMPTION
4203.1
For any rental unit previously exempt from the Rent Stabilization Program by 
§ 205(a) of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-3502.05(a)) and § 4106 of this title, 
the initial rent that may be charged shall be determined in accordance with this 
section upon the occurrence of any event that causes that rental unit to lose its 
exempt status.
4203.2
A housing provider of a rental unit previously exempt from coverage of the Rent 
Stabilization Program shall file a Registration/Claim of Exemption Form in 
accordance with § 4101 within thirty (30) days of the event that causes the unit to 
lose its exemption.  The Registration/Claim of Exemption Form shall state the 
rent lawfully determined in accordance with this section unless the applicable 
determination cannot be made because the unit is vacant.  If the unit loses its 
exemption solely because of the termination of a tenant-specific rent subsidy, the 
housing provider shall file a properly completed Amended Registration Form as 
required by § 4106.11. 
4203.3
The initial, lawful rent that shall be the basis for future rent adjustments for a 
rental unit previously exempt from the Rent Stabilization Program by §§ 205(a)
(1) or (5) (D.C. Official Code §§ 42-3502.05(a)(1), (5)) and §§ 4106.9-4106.11 or 
4108 of this title (the government subsidy exemption or the cooperative housing 
exemption) shall be no greater than: 
(a)
If the unit is occupied when the exemption terminates, the sum of:
(1)
The rent charged on the last date before the unit became exempt; 
plus
(2)
Each annual adjustment of general applicability that was 
authorized during the period in which the unit was exempt; or
(b)
If the unit is vacant when the exemption terminates, either:
(1)
One hundred ten percent (110%) of the amount allowable under 
paragraph (a); or
(2)
The rent charged for a specific, substantially identical rental unit in 
the same housing accommodation, but not greater than one 
hundred thirty percent (130%) of the amount allowable under 
paragraph (a).
4203.4
In making the determination required by § 4203.3, if neither the Rent 
Administrator nor the housing provider can produce a record or stamped copy of 
the original filing stating the rent charged on the date the rental unit became 
Housing

District of Columbia Municipal Regulations
 
exempt, the lawful rent on the termination of the exemption shall be no greater 
than the lowest of:
(a)
The amount computed by § 4203.3(a), using the most recent rent charged 
that is on file with the Rent Administrator before the date the unit became 
exempt;
(b)
The Small Area Fair Market Rent published by the United States 
Department of Housing and Urban Development for the statistical area 
that includes the District of Columbia, based on unit size and zip code; or
(c)
The average rent during the last six (6) consecutive months in which the 
unit was leased to and occupied by a tenant and exempt from the Rent 
Stabilization Program.
4203.5
The initial, lawful rent that shall be the basis for future rent adjustments for a 
rental unit previously exempt from the Rent Stabilization Program by § 205(a)(3) 
of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-3502.05(a)(3)) and § 4107 of this title (the 
small landlord exemption) shall be no greater than one hundred five percent 
(105%) of the average rent during the last six (6) consecutive months in which the 
unit was leased to and occupied by a tenant and exempt from the Rent 
Stabilization Program. 
4203.6
For a rental unit covered by §§ 4203.3, 4203.4, or 4203.5, if the rent charged after 
the termination of the exemption will be greater than the last rent prior to the 
termination of the exemption or than the average rent during the last six (6) 
consecutive months in which the unit was leased to and occupied by a tenant and 
exempt from the Rent Stabilization Program, the housing provider shall file a 
Certificate of Rent Adjustment in accordance with § 4204.10 at the same time the 
housing provider registers the unit in accordance with § 4101 and shall implement 
the rent adjustment in accordance with § 4205.
4203.7
A rental unit that would be exempt from the Rent Stabilization Program pursuant 
to § 205(a)(2) of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-3502.05(a)(2)) and § 4106.12 
of this title (the new construction exemption), but is not exempt because it was 
constructed in place of a demolished housing accommodation that consisted of a 
number of rental units equal to or greater than the new construction and that was 
covered by the Rent Stabilization Program shall be considered a newly 
established rental unit in accordance with § 4201.3.
4203.8
The initial, lawful rent that shall be the basis for future rent adjustments for a 
rental unit for which the rent was previously regulated by a multi-family 
assistance program of the Department of Housing and Community Development 
and exempt from the Rent Stabilization Program pursuant to § 205(a)(7) of the 
Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-3502.05(a)(7)) and § 4106.16 of this title, upon the
