CHANGES IN RENT
5719.1
(a)
Rent Phase-In. If a tenant’s monthly rent increases by more than the 
greater of ten percent (10%) or twenty-five dollars ($25) purely as a result 
of RAD conversion, the rent increase will be phased in over a period of 
five (5) years. The tenants that will be affected by RAD rent calculation at 
the time of conversion are those that are currently paying flat rent, i.e., 
rent that is not calculated based on income. If a tenant was previously 
paying flat rents, the change in rent (now based on 30% of income) may 
have to be phased in.
(b)
Five Year Phase-in Formula:
(1)
Year 1: Any recertification (interim or annual) performed prior to 
the second annual recertification after conversion – twenty percent 
(20%) of difference between most recently paid TTP or flat rent 
and the Calculated RAD TTP
(2)
Year  2:  Year  2  annual  recertification  and  any  interim 
recertification prior to Year 3 annual recertification – twenty-five 
percent (25%) of difference between most recently paid TTP and 
the Calculated RAD TTP
(3)
Year  3:  Year  3  annual  recertification  and  any  interim 
recertification prior to Year 4 annual recertification – thirty-three 
percent (33%) of difference between most recently paid TTP and 
the Calculated RAD TTP
(4)
Year  4:  Year  4  annual  recertification  and  any  interim 
recertification prior to Year 5 annual recertification – fifty percent 
(50%) of difference between most recently paid TTP and the 
Calculated RAD TTP
(5)
Year 5 annual recertification and all subsequent recertifications – 
Full Calculated RAD TTP
(c)
Once the Calculated RAD TTP is equal to or less than the previous TTP, 
the phase-in ends and tenants will pay full TTP from that point forward.

5719.2 
Any changes in Tenant Rent shall be stated in a special supplement to the lease, 
which shall, upon issuance, become a part of the dwelling lease. The special 
supplement to the lease shall constitute the tenants thirty (30) days’ written notice 
of an increase in Tenant Rent.  The family shall be provided a copy of the special 
supplement to the lease.
5719.3 
All changes in Tenant Rent, whether after an interim or regular recertification,

chapter.

by the Owner Tenant Rent payable to DCHA under the dwelling lease shall be the 
same as total tenant payment.
5719.5 
Tenant Rent shall be computed after both annual income and adjusted income 
have been verified.
5719.6 
The tenant shall receive retroactive credit to credit an administrative error.
5719.7 
Tenants occupying property for a portion of a month at the time of move-in shall 
be charged a pro-rata share of the full monthly rate determined by DCHA.
5719.8
Allowances and special deductions:
Housing
14 DCMR § 5719
District of Columbia Municipal Regulations
 
(a)
In properties where tenants are responsible for paying for their own utility 
bills,  the  utility  allowance  shall  be  subtracted  from  the  total  tenant 
payment to determine the Tenant Rent payable to DCHA. If the Tenant 
Rent resulting from the subtraction of the utility allowance from the total 
payment is negative, DCHA shall send a monthly check in the amount of 
the difference to the tenant.
(b)
At Redeveloped Properties or Service Rich Properties, as defined in  14 
DCMR Section 6113, which an Association Fee is assessed, residents at 
such properties may be required to pay an amount calculated to equal the 
Association Fee attributable to the unit and shall be granted an allowance 
reflecting  the  Association Fee  payment.  The  allowance  shall  be 
subtracted from the Tenant Rent to determine the tenant payment as 
follows:
(1)
Any utility allowance shall be deducted from the Tenant Rent first. 
The allowance for the Association Fee shall be deducted from any 
remaining  positive  amount.  If  the  deduction  of  the  utility 
allowance results in a negative rent there shall be no charge for an 
Association  Fee  and  no  deduction  for  the  Association  Fee 
allowance.  If  the  deduction  of  the  Association  Fee  allowance 
results in a negative amount, the required Association Fee payment 
from the tenant and its associated allowance shall be reduced so 
that the Tenant Rent is zero.  
(2)
If the tenant fails to pay the Association Fee on time, the fee shall 
be converted to rent, not to exceed thirty percent (30%) of adjusted 
income, when added to the monthly rent, for the month in which 
the fee was paid.
(3)
If the Association Fee is paid after entry of judgment as part of the 
payment required to avoid eviction, the fee shall be recorded as the 
Association Fee, and the ledger shall be updated to reflect the 
tenant’s payments.
