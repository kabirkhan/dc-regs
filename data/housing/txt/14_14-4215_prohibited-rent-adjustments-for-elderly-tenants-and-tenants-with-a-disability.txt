PROHIBITED  RENT  ADJUSTMENTS  FOR  ELDERLY 
TENANTS AND TENANTS WITH A DISABILITY
4215.1
An approved rent surcharge for which petition was approved after October 1, 
2018, shall not be implemented on and shall be removed from a rental unit while 
the unit is occupied by an elderly tenant or a tenant with a disability with a 
qualifying income, as published annually by the Commission (“protected tenant”).
4215.2
For the purposes of this section, any part of the rent charged for a rental unit shall 
be deemed a rent surcharge if the unit is or becomes occupied by a protected 
tenant and the rent adjustment corresponding to that part of the rent charged was 
approved or implemented pursuant to:
(a)
A related services or facilities petition under § 211 of the Act (D.C. 
Official Code § 42-3502.11) and § 4211 of this chapter that is approved 
after October 1, 2018; or
(b)
A voluntary agreement under § 215 of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-
3502.15) and § 4213 of this chapter approved after April 7, 2017. 
4215.3
A rent surcharge listed in § 4215.2 may be implemented for a rental unit occupied 
by a protected tenant if the protected tenant waives his or her rights under that 
subsection in a written document that states that the waiver is made voluntarily, 
without coercion, and with full knowledge of the ramifications of a waiver of their 
rights.  A  copy  of  the  written  waiver  shall  be  filed  with  the  Rental 
Accommodations  Division  simultaneously  with  the  Certificate  of  Rent 
Adjustment that shows the implementation of the rent surcharge.
4215.4
Notwithstanding § 4215.1, a rent surcharge, not including a rent surcharge based 
on a voluntary agreement, may be implemented for a rental unit occupied by a 
protected  tenant  if  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  of  the  District  of  Columbia 
determines and notifies the Rent Administrator in writing that funds are not 
available for the housing provider to receive the tax credit established by § 224(g) 
of the Act (D.C. Official Code § 42-3502.24(g)).  The Rent Administrator shall 
notify any affected housing provider in writing, by U.S. mail or email, if funds are 
not available and shall include a copy of the Chief Financial Officer’s written 
determination.
4215.5
A rent surcharge authorized under § 4215.4 may be implemented by filing and 
serving a notice of rent adjustment in accordance with §§ 4204 and 4205, which 
shall include a copy of the Chief Financial Officer’s written determination on the 
availability of funds.
4215.6
Authorization to implement a rent surcharge under § 4215.4 shall not permit a 
housing provider to increase any rent less than twelve (12) months after any prior 
increase in the rent charged for the rental unit, as provided by § 4204.1, or during 
Housing

the term of a valid, written lease that establishes the rent charged, as provided by 
§ 4204.12.  
4215.7
Authorization to implement a rent surcharge under § 4215.4 shall not permit a 
housing provider to implement more than one (1) rent adjustment at a time, as 
provided by § 4204.1, except for any approved and previously implemented rent 
surcharges for which tax credits have become unavailable.
4215.8
Notwithstanding § 4204.1, after a protected tenant vacates a rental unit, if the unit 
has become entirely vacant, a housing provider may re-implement any approved 
and previously implemented rent surcharges for the rental unit in addition to 
implementing a vacancy adjustment under § 4207.
4215.9
The Commission shall publish before March 1 of each year, in addition to the 
certifications required by § 4206.3, the maximum annual household income that 
qualifies for status as a protected tenant.  The revised income qualification shall 
take effect on the same day the annual adjustment of general applicability for the 
year.
4215.10
A tenant may apply for protected tenant status, for the purposes of this section or 
for  the  purposes  of  § 4206.7  without  regard  to  income,  by  completing  a 
registration form published by the Rent Administrator and filing it with the Rental 
Accommodations  Division,  along  with  the  necessary  documentation,  as 
determined by the Mayor in accordance with § 224(d) of the Act (D.C. Official 
Code § 42-3502.24(d)), to support the claim. 
4215.11
The Rent Administrator shall immediately send notice, by U.S. mail or email, to 
the housing provider of a tenant who files a completed application in accordance 
with § 4215.10, stating the date of the filing and whether the tenant claims to be 
an elderly tenant, tenant with a disability, or to have a qualifying income.
4215.12
A tenant’s protected status shall be effective on the first day of the first month that 
begins  at  least  five  (5)  days  after  the  filing  of  a  completed  application  in 
accordance with § 4215.10.  The protected status shall be and shall remain 
effective unless and until:
(a)
The Rent Administrator issues an order determining that the tenant failed 
to demonstrate that he or she is an elderly tenant, is a tenant with a 
disability, or, if required, has a qualifying income; or
(b)
The term of the tenant’s certification expires as may be determined by the 
Mayor  pursuant  to  § 224(j)  of  the  Act  (D.C.  Official  Code  § 42-
3502.24(j)).
4215.13
The housing provider of tenant claiming protected status may file a request that 
the Rent Administrator deny the tenant’s application if:
Housing

District of Columbia Municipal Regulations
 
(a)
Thirty (30) days or less has elapsed since the completed application was

does not qualify for protected status or that relevant documentation is 
fraudulent or has been falsified;
(c)
The housing provider has contacted and conferred with the tenant in a 
good faith effort to resolve the dispute; and
(d)
The housing provider serves a copy of the request on the tenant prior to or 
simultaneously with filing the request with the Rent Administrator.
4215.14
The  Rent  Administrator  shall  issue  an  order  denying  a  tenant’s  completed 
application for protected status only if:
(a)
Thirty (30) days or less has elapsed since the completed application was 
filed;
(b)
The  tenant  has  been  given  notice  that  the  Rent  Administrator  has 
substantial grounds to believe that the tenant does not qualify for protected 
status and that relevant documentation is fraudulent or has been falsified, 
and the tenant has been given an opportunity to respond; and
(c)
The Rent Administrator finds clear and convincing evidence of error, 
fraud, falsification, or misrepresentation in the completed application or 
relevant documentation.
4215.15
If the Rent Administrator finds that an application for protected status should be 
denied with regard to income but does not find clear and convincing evidence of 
error, fraud, falsification, or misrepresentation with regard to age or disability, the 
Rent Administrator shall issue an order denying the application for protected 
status only for the purposes of rent surcharges as provided in this section but not 
for the purposes of adjustments of general applicability as provided in § 4206.7.
4215.16
By the effective date of a tenant’s protected status without regard to income, a 
housing provider shall implement a rent rollback as required by § 4206.8.
4215.17
If  a  housing  provider  has  implemented  a  rent  rollback  in  accordance  with 
§ 4215.16 by the effective date of a tenant’s protected status, and the Rent 
Administrator has subsequently denied the tenant’s application, and if the Rent 
Administrator finds that the tenant acted in bad faith, as defined in § 4217.7, then 
within twenty-one (21) days of the denial, the Rent Administrator may order the 
tenant to pay to the housing provider double the difference between the amount of 
the rolled-back rent and the otherwise-lawful rent for the rental unit.

4215.18
By the effective date of a tenant’s protected status with regard to income, a 
housing provider shall implement a rent rollback of all surcharges prohibited by 
this section.
4215.19
In  any  administrative  proceeding  on  a  housing  provider’s  petition  or  an 
application for approval of a voluntary agreement in which a tenant’s protected 
status is a relevant issue to the approval or denial, in whole or in part, of the 
petition or application, the Rent Administrator, on his or her own initiative or at 
the request of the Office of Administrative Hearings, shall transmit a copy of each 
completed application for protected status, whether or not a claim of qualifying 
income has been made, that has been filed and not administratively denied, for 
any current tenant of the housing accommodation.  The Rent Administrator or 
Office of Administrative Hearings, in their discretion, may stay a proceeding on a 
petition or application for a reasonable time to allow for the filing, review, and 
contest of any application(s) for protected status in accordance with this section.
