INTERLOCUTORY APPEALS
3922.1
An interlocutory appeal is an appeal taken by a party prior to the issuance of a 
final decision and order by the Rent Administrator in a proceeding. 
3922.2
An interlocutory appeal shall be permitted only if the Rent Administrator certifies 
the issue for review by the Commission on his or her own initiative or by motion 
of any party to a proceeding before the Rental Accommodations Division.
3922.3
A party seeking review by interlocutory appeal shall file a motion for certification 
within ten (10) days of a ruling by the Rent Administrator. The Rent 
Administrator shall rule on the motion within ten (10) days following the filing of 
the motion.
3922.4
The Rent Administrator shall certify an interlocutory appeal only if he or she 
determines that the issue presented is of such importance in a proceeding that it 
requires the immediate attention of the Commission, and only if the following are 
shown:
(a)
The issue presented involves an important question of law or policy 
requiring interpretation of the Act or this title, and about which there is 
substantial basis for difference of opinion; and
(b)
Either of the following applies:
(1)
An immediate decision will materially advance the disposition of a 
petition, application, or complaint before the Rental 
Accommodations Division; or
(2)
Refusal to make or issue an immediate ruling will cause undue 
harm to the parties or the public.
3922.5
If certification is denied, the ruling may be raised as part of an appeal of the final 
decision of the Rent Administrator or, if the case is later transferred to the Office 
of Administrative Hearings, the final decision of the Office of Administrative 
Hearing.
