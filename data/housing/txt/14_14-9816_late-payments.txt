LATE PAYMENTS
9816.1
If  the  Savings  Escrow,  Maintenance  Escrow  or  AYBL  Tenant  Rent 
payment is not received by the tenth (10th) of the month, an AYBL Non-
Compliance Notice shall be issued. DCHA will assess a late charge for 
payments not received by tenth (10th) of month.
9816.2   
If payment is received within the month for which the payment was due, 
the Notice of Non-Compliance for non-payment will be deemed cured.  
Any payment received after the end of the month for which the payment is 
due will automatically convert to rent. The Notice of Non-Compliance for 
failure to pay rent by the end of the month will also serve as the AYBL 
families second Notice of Non-compliance. If the AYBL family has not 
paid all amounts due by the tenth (10th) of the next month, DCHA will 
issue a third Notice of Non-Compliance for non-payment, which is a basis 
for termination from the AYBL program.   Any charges still outstanding 
will be converted to rent due as defined in the Public Housing Dwelling 
Lease.  After service of the third Notice of Non-Compliance the AYBL 
family may be terminated from the program.  Failure to pay the converted 
rent may result in DCHA initiating a landlord and tenant action in the 
Landlord and Tenant Branch of the D.C. Superior Court for non-payment 
of rent. 
9816.3  
An AYBL Family may receive two (2) Notices of Non-Compliance within 
any twelve (12)-month period.  Any additional late payments will result  
in a Notice of Termination.
