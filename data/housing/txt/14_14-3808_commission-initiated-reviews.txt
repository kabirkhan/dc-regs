After the time for any party to file a notice of appeal has expired pursuant to 
§ 3802.2, the Commission may, within thirty (30) days, initiate a review of any 
final order of the Rent Administrator or the Office of Administrative Hearings if 
the Commission has reason to believe that the order may be erroneous in any 
material way.

The Commission shall serve the parties and representatives of record, if any, who 
appeared before the Rent Administrator or the Office of Administrative Hearings, 
with its reasons for initiating a review (“Notice of Commission Review”).
3808.3
A Notice of Commission Review shall provide:
(a)
A clear and concise statement of any issue(s) that may have been 
erroneously decided by the Rent Administrator or Office of 
Administrative Hearings; 
(b)
A statement that the record will be requested in accordance with § 3804, 
and that a scheduling order will be issued in accordance with § 3802.9; 
and
(c)
A statement regarding whether the final order is stayed in accordance with 
§ 3805. 
3808.4
The Commission shall provide each party the right to present arguments in 
accordance with § 3802.  The party adversely affected by the issue(s) identified 
by the Commission shall be treated as the appellant, or the Commission may treat 
the issue(s) as cross-appealed.
3808.5
Any party may move at any time after the Commission has initiated a review to 
dismiss the review.  A motion to dismiss shall not waive any right to relief that a 
party may have if the Commission does not dismiss the review and ultimately

Any party may move, prior to the due date of the initial brief, for summary 
affirmance or reversal of the final order.
3808.7
A Notice of Commission Review shall be issued only by order of a quorum of the 
Commission.
3808.8
The Commission shall reverse a final order under this section only where the 
Commission determines that the order contains an error of law or clearly 
erroneous findings of fact.  Neither a party that prevailed before nor a party that 
was adversely affected by the decision of the Rent Administrator or Office of 
Housing
