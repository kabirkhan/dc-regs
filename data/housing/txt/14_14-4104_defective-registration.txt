DEFECTIVE REGISTRATION
4104.1
The Rent Administrator shall review each Registration/Claim of Exemption Form 
after accepting it for filing in accordance with § 4102.10 in order to determine if 
the form has been properly completed.  
4104.2
If the Rent Administrator determines at any time that a registration is defective 
under § 4104.3, the Rent Administrator shall notify the housing provider in 
writing of the specific defect(s) and allow the housing provider thirty (30) days to 
correct the defect(s) by returning a properly completed Registration/Claim of 
Exemption Form to the Rent Administrator.
4104.3
A  “defective  registration”  means  a  Registration/Claim  of  Exemption  Form 
contains incorrect or is missing information that is de minimis (trivial or minor) 
and does not materially or substantially affect the validity of the registration. 
Examples of such defects may include, but are not limited to, the following:
(a)
The form is not signed;
(b)
Information is entered incorrectly on the form;
(c)
The  housing  business  license  required  by  § 4102.5  exists  but  is  not 
included; 
(d)
Some, but not all, contact information required by § 4102.6 is missing or 
incorrect; provided that all required persons are correctly identified on the 
form;
(e)
Supporting documentation for a claimed exemption required by § 4106 
exists but is not included; or
(f)
Proof that the rental unit registration fee was paid as required by § 4109 
exists but is not included.
4104.4
A defective registration shall not be deemed invalid solely because of a defective 
registration, unless a housing provider fails to correct the defect(s) after being 
provided notice.
4104.5
If a housing provider has been notified by the Rent Administrator of a defective 
registration and the housing provider does not correct the defects within thirty 
(30) days of the issuance of the notice, the registration shall be deemed invalid, 
and the housing provider shall be found to have failed to meet the registration 
requirements of this chapter, retroactive to the date of its filing.
4104.6
If  a  housing  provider’s  registration  is  invalidated  pursuant  to  § 4104.5,  the 
housing provider shall file a new Registration/Claim of Exemption Form in 
Housing

accordance with § 4102 and post or serve a copy of the form in accordance with 
§ 4101.6.
4104.7
If a housing provider corrects all defects identified by the Rent Administrator 
within thirty (30) days of notice, the correction(s) shall be deemed incorporated 
into the registration, retroactive to the date of its filing.
4104.8
If incorrect or missing information resulting in a defective registration appears on 
the form that was posted or served in accordance with § 4101.6, the housing 
provider shall post or serve a true copy of the correction form, in the same manner 
as done originally, within fifteen (15) days of returning the correction form to the 
Rent Administrator.
4104.9
Nothing in this section shall be construed to protect or limit the liability of a 
housing provider who deceptively, fraudulently, in bad faith, or willfully omits or 
misstates any information required for registration.
4104.10
Registration/Claim  of  Exemption  Forms  that  contain  substantial  or  material 
misstatements or omissions shall be deemed invalid, and the housing provider 
shall be found to have failed to meet the registration requirements of this chapter, 
retroactive to the date of filing.  The Rent Administrator shall promptly notify a 
housing provider in writing if a registration is discovered to be invalid for those 
reasons or is invalidated pursuant to § 4104.5 and may take any available action 
or pursue any available remedies to enforce the registration requirements of the 
Act.
