ABATEMENT OF RENT
5727.1
In the event that a unit is rendered uninhabitable and repairs are not made as 
provided for in § 5758, the Project Owner shall abate the tenant's total tenant 
payment in proportion to the seriousness of the damage and loss in value as a 
dwelling.
5727.2
No abatement of rent shall occur if the tenant fails to cooperate with workmen 
seeking to make the repairs, rejects alternative accommodations, or if the damage 
was caused by the tenant, the tenant’s household, or guests.
5727.3
Evidence that a unit was uninhabitable under § 5758, and that abatement is 
required, may include a vacate order by a District Housing Inspector, or other 
substantial documentation.
