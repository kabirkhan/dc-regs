TENANTS UNDER THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT

In certain circumstances, as further explained below, applicants or tenants may be 
afforded additional protections from DCHA requirements and policies under the 
Violence Against Women Act (“VAWA”).  DCHA shall comply with the terms 
of VAWA in administration of public housing. VAWA protections are for victims 
of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, regardless of 
sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation. DCHA shall not discriminate against 
VAWA victims on the basis of any protected categories pursuant to 24 CFR § 
5.105(a)  including  race,  color,  national  origin,  religion,  sex,  familial  status, 
disability, or age. 
6127.2
DCHA will provide to applicants deemed ineligible for admission to public 
housing and public housing tenants the “Notice of Occupancy Rights under the 
Violence Against Women Act” and the HUD-approved certification form in 
accordance with HUD rules and regulations. 
6127.3 
Applicants seeking admission to DCHA public housing units shall not be denied 
admission to public housing on the basis of or as a direct result of the fact that the 
applicant is or has been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual 
assault, or stalking, if the applicant otherwise qualifies for admission, assistance, 
participation, or occupancy. 
6127.4 
Pursuant to federal regulations, DCHA shall not terminate tenancy for tenants 
protected under VAWA on the basis of, or as a direct result of, the fact that the 
tenant is or has been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual 
assault, or stalking, if the tenant otherwise qualifies for admission, assistance, 
participation, or occupancy. 
6127.5 
Pursuant to federal regulations, DCHA shall not deny tenancy or occupancy rights 
on the basis of criminal activity directly relating to domestic violence, dating 
violence, sexual assault, or stalking if the criminal activity is engaged in by a 
member of the household of the tenant or any guest or other person under the 
control of the tenant; and the tenant or an affiliated individual of the tenant is the 
victim or threatened victim of such domestic violence, dating violence, sexual 
assault, or stalking. 
6127.6
Pursuant  to  federal  regulations,  incidents  of  actual  or  threatened  domestic 
violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking shall not be construed as a 
serious or repeated lease violation by the victim or threatened victim of such 
incidents; or good cause for terminating the tenancy or occupancy rights of the 
victim or threatened victim of such incidents.
6127.7 
Notwithstanding Subsections 6127.4, 6127.5, and 6127.6, DCHA may terminate 
tenancy for any violation not premised on an act of domestic violence, dating 
Housing

violence, sexual assault, or stalking, provided that DCHA does not subject such a 
tenant  to  a  more  demanding  standard  than  other  tenants  in  making  the 
determination whether to evict or terminate the tenancy.
6127.8 
Notwithstanding Subsections 6127.4, 6127.5, and 6127.6, DCHA may terminate 
tenancy if DCHA demonstrates that an actual and imminent threat to other 
tenants, employees, or others providing service to a public housing property 
would be present if a tenant or lawful occupant is not evicted. 
6127.9
Prior to terminating tenancy under Subsection 6127.8, DCHA shall consider other 
actions that may be taken to reduce or eliminate the threat, including, but not 
limited to, transferring the victim to a different unit, barring the perpetrator from 
the property, contacting law enforcement to increase police presence or develop 
other plans to keep the property safe, or seeking other legal remedies to prevent 
the perpetrator from acting on a threat. 
6127.10
DCHA shall comply with a court order addressing rights of access or control of 
property, including civil protection orders issued to protect a victim of domestic 
violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking
6127.11
Tenants  or  applicants  seeking  VAWA  protections  shall  provide  to  DCHA 
documentation of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.

violence, dating violence, or stalking as follows:

(c)
Documentation that is signed by the victim and signed by an employee, 
agent, or volunteer of a victim service provider, or an attorney, or mental

that the incident or incidents of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual 
assault, or stalking are grounds for VAWA protection.
6127.13

(a) 
If DCHA receives conflicting documentation of domestic violence, dating 
violence, sexual assault, or stalking from two (2) or more members of a

District of Columbia Municipal Regulations
 
require third-party documentation to resolve the conflict in accordance 
with  VAWA  and  its  implementing  regulations.  DCHA  will  review 
conflicting allegations through the process specified in § 6127.13(c). 
(b)

convene a conflicting allegations panel within five (5) business days to 
recommend which Family member’s request will be granted in accordance 
with the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and its implementing 
regulations, as explained in §§ 6127.1, and other applicable laws using the 
following guidelines:

if one is provided, and by phone, if a phone number is provided, 
that only one (1) part of the family shall continue to receive 
assistance;

The notice shall inform both adults of how DCHA will determine 
who retains assistance, and what relevant information each adult 
can provide to assist DCHA in making its recommendation;

(including, but not limited to, police report(s), protective orders, 
restraining orders, photographs, video footage, any past history of 
abuse, or evidence of who is the primary aggressor), DCHA shall 
notify both adults in writing of its decision and the basis for the 
decision; and
(4)
If DCHA denies the request, DCHA shall provide to the adult 
household member written notice and the opportunity to grieve in

case, DCHA shall ensure that the victim retains assistance;
(2)
The interest of minor children; or
(3)
The interest of an ill, elderly, or disabled Family member.
6127.14
A tenant who has been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual 
assault,  or  stalking  may  request  an  emergency  VAWA  transfer  pursuant  to 
Section 6402 and Subsections 6127.14 through 6127.18 of this title, if: 
(a)
the tenant reasonably believes that there is a threat of imminent harm from 
further violence if the tenant were to remain in the same dwelling unit 
assisted under DCHA’s program; or 
(b)
the tenant was a sexual assault victim and that the sexual assault occurred 
on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the tenant’s 
request for an emergency VAWA transfer.
6127.15
A tenant requesting an emergency VAWA transfer pursuant to § 6127.14, must 
submit a written request to transfer. A tenant may submit a DCHA or HUD-
approved emergency VAWA transfer form, or provide a written statement that 
includes either:

that there is a threat of imminent harm from further violence if the tenant 
were to remain in the same dwelling unit assisted under DCHA’s program; 
or

A statement certifying that the tenant was a sexual assault victim and that 
the  sexual  assault  occurred  on  the  premises  during  the  ninety  (90)-
Housing

District of Columbia Municipal Regulations
 
calendar-day  period  preceding  the  tenant’s  request  for  an  emergency 
VAWA transfer.  
6127.16 
If a tenant requests an emergency VAWA transfer under the protections of 
VAWA, DCHA will request in writing that the tenant provide documentation in 
accordance with Subsection 6127.12.
6127.17
Tenants must provide the documentation required under Subsection 6127.12 
within  fourteen  (14)  business  days  of  receiving  the  written  request  for 
documentation.  If  DCHA  receives  conflicting  documentation  of  domestic 
violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking from two or more members 
of a household, each claiming to be a victim and naming one or more of the other 
petitioning  household  members  as  the  perpetrator,  Subsection  6127.13  shall 
apply.
6127.18

notice of intent to vacate the unit if the family moved to protect the health or 
safety of the victim.

remove, or terminate occupancy rights to any lessee or household member who 
engages  in  criminal  activity  directly  relating  to  domestic  violence,  dating 
violence, sexual assault, or stalking against an affiliated individual or other 
individual, without evicting, removing, or otherwise penalizing a victim of such 
criminal activity who is also a tenant or lawful occupant. A lease bifurcation shall 
be carried out in accordance with federal and local law for termination of tenancy 
and eviction, and in accordance with HUD requirements. 
6127.20
If DCHA exercises the option to bifurcate a lease, DCHA will execute a new 
lease with the victim in accordance with federal and local requirements. If the 
evicted household member was the eligible tenant, the remaining tenant(s) or 
lawful occupant(s) that was not already eligible shall be given a period of thirty 
(30) calendar days from the date of bifurcation of the lease to: 
(a)
Establish eligibility for the DCHA public housing program; or 
(b)
Find alternative housing. 
If the remaining tenant or lawful occupant(s) fails to establish eligibility or find 
alternative  housing,  DCHA  will  pursue  eviction  through  court  process  in 
accordance with local law.
6127.21
Any information submitted to DCHA under this section, including the fact that an 
individual is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or 
stalking, shall be maintained in strict confidence by DCHA.
