DCHA TERMINATION OF ASSISTANCE 
5753.1
DCHA may terminate program assistance for the Participant for any grounds 
authorized in accordance with HUD requirements. 
 
5753.2
Upon notification that the Project Owner has instituted a legal action to gain 
possession of the dwelling unit, DCHA shall determine if the Participant has 
committed serious or repeated violations of the lease.  If DCHA determines that a 
Participant has committed serious or repeated violations of the lease, DCHA shall 
issue a determination to terminate assistance. DCHA shall stay enforcement of the 
determination to terminate assistance until the court eviction process concludes. 
5753.3
Pursuant to 24 CFR § 983.258, Housing Assistance Payments shall continue until 
the Tenant Rent of a new admission to a RAD Covered Project equals the rent to 
the owner. The cessation of housing assistance payments at such point will not 
affect the family’s other rights under its lease, nor will such cessation preclude the 
resumption of payments as a result of later changes in income, rents, or other 
relevant circumstances if such changes occur within one hundred eighty (180) 
days following the date of the last housing assistance payment by the PHA. After 
the 180-day period, the unit shall be removed from the HAP contract pursuant to 
24 CFR § 983.211.
5753.4 
In any case where DCHA decides to terminate assistance to the Participant, 
DCHA shall give the Participant a thirty (30) day written termination notice 
which states:
(a)
The reasons for the termination; 
(b)
The effective date of the termination; 
(c)
The Participant’s right to request an informal hearing; and
(d)
The Family’s responsibility to enter into a new unassisted lease and pay 
the full rent to the Project Owner if they remain in the unit.
